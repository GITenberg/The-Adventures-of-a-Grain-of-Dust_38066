<h2>JUST A WORD</h2>


<p>I don't want you to think that I'm boasting, but I <i>do</i>
believe I'm one of the greatest travellers that ever was;
and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with
more than I have I'd like to hear about it.</p>

<p>Not that I've personally been in all the places or taken
part in all the things I tell in this book&mdash;I don't mean to
say that&mdash;but I do ask you to remember how long it is
possible for a grain of dust to last, and how many other
far-travelled and much-adventured dust grains it must
meet and mix with in the course of its life.</p>

<p>The heart of the most enduring grains of dust is a little
particle of sand, the very hardest part of the original rock
fragment out of which it was made. That's what makes
even the finest mud seem gritty when it dries on your
feet. And the longer these sand grains last the harder
they get, as you may say; for it is the hardest part that
remains, of course, as the grain wears down. Moreover,
the smaller it gets the less it wears. If it happens to be
spending its time on the seashore, for example, the very
same kind of waves that buffet it about so, waves that,
farther down the beach hurl huge blocks of stone against
the cliffs and crack them to pieces, not only do not wear
away the sand grains, to speak of, but actually save them
from wear. The water between the grains protects them;
like little cushions. And the sand in the finer dust grains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
carried by the wind is protected by the material that
gathers on its surface.</p>

<p>Why, if a pebble of the size of a hickory-nut may be
ages and ages old&mdash;almost in the very form in which you
see it,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> think what the age of this long-enduring part of a
grain of dust must be.</p>


<p>Then remember what the ever-changing material on the
surface of these immortal grains is made of; the dust particles
of plants and animals, of buried Cæsars and still
older ancients, such as those early settlers of Chapter II.</p>

<p>Finally, if what we call flesh and blood can think and
talk, why not a grain of dust? In fact, what is flesh and
blood but dust come back to life? Says the poet&mdash;and the
poets know:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The very dust that blows along the street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once whispered to its love that life is sweet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You see it's as likely a thing as could happen&mdash;this
whole story.</p>

<p class="right">

there was nothing to eat? When the continents first rose
out of the sea<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> there wasn't anything to eat but rock.
Rock, to be sure, makes very good eating if you have the
stomach for it, as Mr. Lichen has. It contains sulphur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
phosphorus, silica, potash, soda, iron, and other things
that plants are fond of, but ordinary plants can't get these
things out of the rock&mdash;let alone human beings and other
animals; and that's why Mr. Lichen had the first seat at
the table and always does.</p>

<p>On bare granite boulders in the fields, on the rocky
ruins at the foot of mountains, and even on the mountain
tops themselves, on projecting rocks far above the snow
line, you find the lichens. On rock of every kind they
settle down and get to work. They never complain of the
climate&mdash;hot or cold, moist or dry. When the land goes
dry they simply knock off, and then when a little moisture
is to be had they're busy again. A little goes a long way
with members of the family who live in regions where
water is scarce. Indeed, most of them get along with
hardly any moisture at all. The very hardiest of them
are so small that a whole colony looks like a mere stain
upon the rock.</p>

<p>While lichens are generally gray&mdash;they seem to have
been <i>born</i> old, these queer little men of the rock&mdash;you can
find some that are black, others bright yellow or cream-colored.
Others are pure white or of various rusty and
leaden shades. Some are of the color of little mice. To
make out any shapes in these tiny forms, you must look
very close; and if you have a hand lens you will be surprised
to find that this fairy-land of the lichens isn't so
drab as it seems to the naked eye. For there are flower
gardens&mdash;the tiny spore cups. Some of them are vivid
crimson and, standing out on a background of pure white,
they're very lovely. Some of the science people believe
the colors attract the minute insects that the lens shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
wandering around in these fairy flower gardens. But just
what the insects can be there for nobody knows, since the
lichens are scattered, not by insects, but by the wind.</p>

<p>As a rule lichens grow only in open, exposed places,
although some are like the violets&mdash;they enjoy the shade.
Some varieties grow on trees, some on the ground, others
on the bleached bones of animals in fields and wastes and
on the bones of whales cast up by the sea.</p>

<p>Of course the whole country was awfully wild when the
continents first came out of the sea, but that just suited
Mr. Lichen, for there is one thing he can't stand, and that
is city life, with its smoke and bad air.</p>

<p>"Why, one can't get one's breath!" he says.</p>


<h5>WHY THE LICHENS DISLIKE CITY LIFE</h5>

<p>So, while you will not meet Mr. Lichen in cities&mdash;at
least, until after the people are all gone; that is to say, on
ruins of cities of the past&mdash;you will find him beautifying
the ancient walls of abbeys, old seats of learning like
Oxford, and the tombstones of the cities of the dead.</p>

<p>Mr. Lichen always travels light. On the surface of the
lichens are what seem to be little grains of dust, and these
serve the purpose of seeds. A puff of wind will carry
away thousands of them, and so start new colonies in
lands remote.</p>

<p>You see, the fact that he requires so little baggage must
have been a great advantage to Mr. Lichen in those early
days, when he had to discover not only America but all
the rest of the world map, spread out so wide and far.
You can just imagine how the grains of lichen dust, the
seed of the race, must have gone whirling across the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
with the winds.</p>

<p>But if a breath of wind would carry them away so easily,
how could they <i>stay</i> on a rock, these tiny lichen travellers?
Especially as they have no roots? They have
curious rootlike fibres which absorb food by dissolving the
rock, and this dissolved rock, hardening, holds them on.
The fibres of lichens that grow on granite actually sink
into it by dissolving the mica and forcing their way between
the other kinds of particles in the rock that they
can't eat. Thus they help break it up.</p>

<p>As we all know, little people are great eaters in proportion
to their size, but it is said the lichens are the heartiest
eaters in the world. They eat more mineral matter than
any other plant, and all plants are eaters of minerals.</p>

<p>Yet, you'd wonder what they do with the food they eat&mdash;most
of them grow so slowly. A student of lichens
watched one of them on the tiled roof of his house in
France&mdash;one of the kind of lichens that look like plates of
gold&mdash;and in forty years he couldn't see that it had grown
a single bit, although he measured it carefully.</p>


<h5>HOW MR. LICHEN EATS UP STONES</h5>

<p>But how could such feeble creatures, as they seem to be,
ever eat anything so hard as rock? Well, they couldn't if
it wasn't for one thing&mdash;they understand chemistry. At
least they carry with them, or know how to make, an
acid, and it's this acid which enables them to dissolve the
rock so that they can absorb it. The acid is in their fibres&mdash;what
answer for roots. And the dissolved rock not
only gives them their daily bread, but, as I said a moment
ago, holds them on. This use of acid is their way of eating;
chewing their food very fine, and mixing it with
saliva, as all of us young people are taught to do.</p>

<p>The first and smallest of the lichen family spread and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
decay into a thin film of soil. This decay makes more
acid, just as decaying leaves do to-day&mdash;they learned it,
no doubt, from the lichens&mdash;and this acid of decay also
eats into the rock and makes more soil. (You see nature,
from the start, has been helping those that help themselves,
just as the old proverb has it.) Then, after the
first tiny lichens&mdash;mere grains of dust that have just begun
to feel the stir of life&mdash;come somewhat larger lichens which
can only live where there is a little soil to begin with.
These in turn die, which means a still deeper layer of soil,
still more acid of decay, and so on up to larger lichens and
later more ambitious plants. Then, on the soil made by
these successive generations of lichens, higher types of
plants&mdash;plants with true roots&mdash;get a foothold.</p>

<p>Besides making soil themselves, the lichens help accumulate
soil by holding grains of rock broken up by their fibres
and loosened by the action of the heat and cold of day
and night and change of season. These little grains become
entangled in the larger lichens and are kept, many
of them, from being washed away by the heavy rains. So
held, they are in time crumbled into soil by the action of
the acids and by mixture with the products of plant decay.
To this day, go where you will, over the whole face
of the earth, and you'll find the lichens there ahead of you,
dressed in their sober suits, some gray as ashes, others
brown, but some are as yellow as gold; for even these
old people like a little color once in a while. As travellers
they beat all.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Their geographical range is more extended than that of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
other class of plants."</p></blockquote>

<p>That's how the learned lichenologists put it. For these
lichens, these humble little brothers of our dust, that many
of us never looked at twice on the stones of the field, or
the gray stumps and dead limbs in the wood, are so interesting
when you've really met them&mdash;been properly introduced&mdash;that
a whole science has grown up around them
called "lichenology." And exciting! You ought to hear
the hot discussions that lichenologists get into. You read,
for instance, that such and such a theory "was received
with a storm of opposition" (as most new theories are,
by the way, particularly if they are sound).</p>

<p>But the tumults and the strifes of science, of politics,
or of wars don't disturb little old Mr. Lichen himself.
There on his rock he'll sit, overlooking the scenery and
watching life and the seasons come and go for 100, 200,
500 years, and more. For while they grow so slowly the
lichens make up for it by living to an extreme age.</p>


<h5>THE LICHENS AND THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h5>

<p>Why, do you know that during the lifetime of certain
lichens that are still hale and hearty, not only a long line
of Cæsars might rise, flourish, die, and, with their clay,
stop holes to keep the wind away, as Mr. Shakespere put
it, but the vast Roman Empire could and did come into
being, move across the stage with its banners and trumpets
and glittering pomp and go back to the dust again.</p>

<p>Some lichens, growing on the highest mountain ranges
of the world, are known to be more than 2,000 years old!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="II._THE_MARCH_OF_THE_TREES" id="II._THE_MARCH_OF_THE_TREES">II. The March of the Trees</a></span></h4>

<p>Of course I don't mean to say it takes any 2,000 years
for the average lichen to die and turn to dust. These
long-lived lichens are the Methuselahs of their race. Most
kinds die much younger, as time goes among the lichens,
and in a comparatively few years, a century say, after
their first settlement on the rock, the lichens have become
soil. All this time the heating of the rock by day and the
cooling off at night, the work of frost and the gases of the
rain and the air<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> have also helped to make more soil and
by and by there is enough for lichens of a larger growth;
and mosses begin to get a foothold. These, in turn, die
and, in decaying, make acids, as did the little lichens before
them, and this acid joins hands with all the other forces to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
work up the rock into soil. Presently there is enough
soil to let certain adventurers of the Weed family drop
in. The picking is very thin, to be sure, but some of these
Weed people have learned to put up with almost anything.
Don't suppose, however, that all weeds are alike
in this respect. Oh, dear, no! They come into new plant
communities just as the trees do, not haphazard, but according
to a certain more or less settled order. Some of
them, the adventurer type, will, it is true, settle down and
seem contented enough on land so poor that to quote the
witty Lady Townshend "you will only find here and there
a single blade of grass and two rabbits fighting for that";
while other weeds will have nothing to do with soil that,
in their opinion, is not good enough for people of their
family connections.</p>

<p class="caption">EARLY SETTLERS IN THE DESERT</p>
<p class="ctext">Besides earning their own living under hard conditions, these sturdy pioneers of the desert
are preparing the way for plants of a higher kind, as the next two pictures will tell you.</p>
</div></div>


<p>It has long been known that the character of soil may
be told, to a considerable degree, by the kind of weeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
that grow on it. An old English writer pointed this out
in his quaint way some 200 years ago:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Ground which, though it bear not any extraordinary abundance
of grass yet will load itself with strong and lusty weeds, as
Hemlocks, Docks, Nettles and such like, is undoubtedly a most
rich and fruitful ground for any grain whatsoever."</p></blockquote>

<p>But, he goes on to say:</p>

<blockquote><p>"When you see the ground covered with Heath, Broom, Bracken,
Gorse and such like, they be most apparent signs of infinite great
barrenness. And, of these infertile places, you shall understand,
that it is the clay ground which for the most part brings forth the
Moss, the Broom, the Gorse and such like."</p></blockquote>

<p>Wherever soil is coarse and bouldery the weeds also are
of a sturdy breed. In his long, delightful days among
the mountains Muir<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> tells us what a brave show the
thistles made in this new world of soil; how royal they
looked in their purple bloom, standing up head and shoulders
above the other plants, like Saul among the people.</p>

keep in sandy soil, always thirsty, like that on the right. But the desert vegetation, dying

moisture and ammonia from the air and so helps grow good crops.</p>

<h5>HOW PLANT PEOPLE PAY THEIR TAXES</h5>

<p>In all these plant republics each citizen must pay something
into the common treasury for its board and keep.
This fund not only meets "national expenses" during the
lifetime of the ones who pay these taxes, but it helps prepare
the land for the great citizens of the future&mdash;the
trees. In another hundred years&mdash;making two hundred
in all, after the arrival of the very first lichens&mdash;low shrubs
and bushes often find spots in these new communities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
where the soil is thick enough for their needs.</p>

<p>It is very curious how members of the plant world,
growing side by side, seek their food at different depths,
and send out their roots accordingly. It reminds one of
the rigid class distinctions below stairs in a nobleman's
household where the chef has his meals in his own private
apartment, the kitchen maids in their quarters, the chauffeurs,
footman, under butler, and pantry boys in the servants'
hall.</p>

<img src="images/i023.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE LEADERS OF THE GRAND MARCH</p>

</div></div>


<p>But most striking, it has always seemed to me, is the
settled order in which trees march into the land. Why
shouldn't the oaks come before the maples? Or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
maples before the beeches? Or the beeches before the
pines? Why is it that, with the exception of a straggler
here and there, the first trees to climb the stony mountainsides
are the pines? Then close behind come such
trees as the poplars, and along the streams below, the
willows. Still farther down the valley are the beeches;
farther still the maples, and last of all the oaks.</p>

<p>So it is they advance in a certain regular way, each in
its own place in the ranks. At first it seems as strange
as the coming of Birnam wood to Dunsinane that gave
poor Macbeth such a turn that time. But, after all, the
explanation is quite simple and no doubt you have guessed
it already.</p>

<p>The reason such trees as the pines, poplars, and willows
come first is that the seeds are so light they are easily carried
by the winds and so reach new soil ahead of other trees
with winged seeds like the beeches and the maples; for,
although these seeds also travel on the wind, they are
much larger than the winged seeds of the pine and they
travel much more slowly and for shorter distances.</p>

<p>Moreover, at the end of their first journey, having once
fallen to the ground, they are apt to stay. Then there is
no further advance, so far as these particular seeds are
concerned, until trees have sprung from them and they, in
turn, bear seeds. In the case of very light seeds, like those
of the pines, the wind not only carries them far beyond the
comparatively slow and heavy march of the beech and
the maple, but if they fall on rock with little or no soil
the next wind picks them up and carries them farther, so
that they may strike some other spot where there is soil
and perhaps a little network of grass and weeds to secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
them until they can take root and so hold their own. It
is not only a great advantage to the pine seeds to be so
small, so far as getting ahead of other trees is concerned,
but it is an advantage in another way. Because they are
so small they require comparatively little soil to start
with, are more easily covered up, and so they soon begin
to sprout. The very winds that carry them up among
the mountain rocks are quite likely to cover them with
enough dust to start on, and I myself have helped raise
many a giant of the mountain forests in this way. It
is really wonderful how little soil a pine-tree can get along
with; if, say, its fortunes are cast on some mass of mountain
rock. Somehow it manages to get a living among the
cracks and at the same time to hold its own in the bitter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
struggle with the winds.</p>

<p>"The pine trees," says Muir, "march up the sun-warmed
moraines in long hopeful files, taking the ground and establishing
themselves as soon as it is ready for them."</p>

<p>Last of all come tramping along the sturdy old oaks
and the nut-bearing trees. Their seeds are so heavy they
get little help from the winds, and then only in the most
violent storms. They must advance very slowly indeed,
with occasional help from absent-minded squirrels who
carry away and bury nuts and acorns and then forget
where they put them.</p>

<h5>ROUGH CITIZENS AMONG THE PIONEERS</h5>

<p>The beginnings of a forest are stunted because the soil
is thin. Moreover, the company in which the trees find
themselves is very miscellaneous, like the population of
all pioneer communities&mdash;weeds, grasses, briers, shrubs.
High up on a mountainside you can find all these types of
vegetation. Pines growing clear to the snow line; farther
down the mountain, in crannies, sumach and elder bushes
with field daisies and goldenrod scattered among them;
while on the barren rocks are the lichens and the mosses.</p>

<p>Not only do the citizens of the plant world follow a
certain fixed order in coming into new regions, but also in
giving place to one another. All plants of a higher order
can live only on the remains of those of a lower, and it is
most interesting to note the process by which each lower
form comes, does its work, passes on, and is replaced by a
superior type. The shrubs, which can only grow after
the weeds and grasses have made enough soil for them, at
length shade out these smaller pioneers. Haven't you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
often noticed, when picnicing in deep woods, that the
grasses and flowers are to be found only in the sunny
spaces, where there are no trees?</p>

<p>But these thickets themselves, after a while, disappear,
and pines take their places. I am speaking now of the
growth of forests, where the soil-making has so far advanced
that forests are possible. The thickets, with their
good soil and the shade which keeps it damp, are just the
places for the pine seeds brought in by the wind to get a
foothold and sprout up. When they grow into big trees
they gather with their high branches so much of the sunshine
for themselves that little of it gets through to the
shrubs below, so these shrubs disappear, surviving only
in the sunny open spaces or along the borders of the wood.</p>

<p>But now notice what happens to the pines. When the
trees become larger, the young pines that spring up beneath
their shade can't get enough sunshine, so, as the big
trees grow old and die, there are fewer and fewer young
pines to take their places. Now comes the turn of the
spruces. For spruces require more and better soil than
the pines and they don't mind a reasonable amount of
shade. So, as the woods grow thicker and shadier, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
pines gradually disappear and the spruces take their
places.</p>

<p>At first, in the reign of the spruces, some of the old residents
begin to come back. A spruce forest, not being so
dense in the beginning as a pine forest, lets in a good deal
of sunlight, and you'll find scattered through its aisles
and byways gentians, bluebells, daisies, goldenrod.</p>

<p>In course of time, however, the leaves and branches of
the spruces become so thick that hardly a sunbeam can
get through and you have a forest where noontime looks
like twilight; a forest of deep shade and silence with its
thick carpet of brown needles, and where all the shrubs
and grasses and flowers have disappeared, except in the
open spaces. It was in such a forest and in one of these
sunny glades, no doubt, that the knight the little girl
tells of in Tennyson:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"... while he past the dim lit woods<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That shook beneath them as the thistle shakes<br /></span>

<h5><a name="HOW_NATURE_RESTORES_ABANDONED_FARMS" id="HOW_NATURE_RESTORES_ABANDONED_FARMS">HOW NATURE RESTORES ABANDONED FARMS</a></h5>

<p>So it is that new lands pass from barren rock to forest,
and deep rich soil, and so it is that worn-out soils, the
result of reckless farming are finally restored. Hardly
any soil is too poor for some kind of a weed. These weeds
springing up, die and make soil that better kinds of weeds
can use. Later come a few woody plants. In the course
of fifteen or twenty years the soil is deep enough to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
trees; and in fifty years there is a young forest. At the
end of a century fine timber can be cut, the land cleared,
and the old place may be as good as new.</p>

<p>But it's a long time to wait! It's a much better plan to
take care of the land in the first place.</p>


<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</p>

<blockquote><p>One of the strangest things about Mr. Lichen, as you will see
by looking up the subject in any botany or encyclopædia, is that
he is really <i>two</i> people&mdash;two different plants that have grown into
partnership; and that one of the partners supplies water for the
firm while the other furnishes the food.</p>

<p>The part of "him" that supplies the food is green, or blue-green,
and that is why it is able to do this. This idea that Mr. Lichen
is really two people was one of those that was "received with a
storm of opposition," but certain lichenologists actually took two
different kinds of plants, put them together and <i>made</i> a lichen
themselves, as you will see when you look the matter up.</p>

<p>As to just who among these two kinds of plants shall go into
partnership&mdash;that usually depends on chance and the winds; although
in the case of some lichens, the parents determine upon
these partnerships, just as they often do in human relations.</p>

<p>If you want to continue this interesting study and become
Learned Lichenologists, you will be interested to know that there
are a lot of things to be learned, including not only no end of delightful
names, such as <i>Endocarpon</i>, <i>Collema</i>, <i>Pertusaria</i>, not to
speak of <i>Xanthoria parietina</i>, and loads of others, but there are
still things unknown that <i>you</i> may be able some day to find out.
For instance, while they know that the two kinds of vegetation
that together make a lichen, feed and water each other, it's not
known exactly <i>how</i> they do it; although the "Britannica" article
has a picture showing the two partners in the very act of going
into partnership. The article in the "Americana" shows some
striking forms of lichens, and how nature from these very dawnings
of life begins to dream of beauty. You will be surprised at
the forms shown in the "Americana," they are either so graceful,
symmetrical, or picturesque. One of them looks like a very elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
helmet decoration, or plume of a knight.</p>

<p>This article also tells what an incredible number of species of
lichens there are&mdash;enough to make quite a good-sized town, if they
were all real people.</p>

<p>It also tells why the orange and yellow lichens take to the shady
side of the rock; and something about how the lichens get those
remarkable decorations and sculpturings, and what the weather
has to do with it.</p>

<p>There you will also get a probable explanation of the fact that
the manna which the Israelites found on the ground in the morning
appeared so suddenly.</p>

<p>In the article in the "International" you will find another picture
of how the two partners&mdash;the fungus and the alga&mdash;make the
lichen, and you will learn that Mr. Lichen's name, like Mr. Lichen
himself, is centuries old; being the very name given him by the
Greeks, and afterward by the Romans.</p>

<p>In the "Country Life Reader" there is an article on the soil that
has a very close relationship to the subject of the lichens and their
work. It tells, among other things, about the value of humus&mdash;decayed
leaves, grass, etc.&mdash;to the soil. It was the lichens, you
know, who <i>started</i> the humus-making business.</p>

<h3>SOME EARLY SETTLERS AND THEIR BONES</h3>


<p>But a farm where nothing but plants grow isn't much
of a farm. Every good farmer knows that nowadays, and
so he stocks his place with horses and cows and chickens
and things. Mother Nature understood this principle
from the beginning, and the plants and animals on her
farm have always got on well together.</p>

<p>For one thing the plant and the animal each help the
other to get its breath. That is to say, plants, when they
take in the air, keep most of the carbon there is in it and
give back most of the oxygen, which is just what the
animal world wants; while the animals, when they breathe,
keep most of the oxygen and give back most of the carbon&mdash;just
the thing that plants grow on.</p>

<p>But the service of the animals to the plants is very important
after they have stopped breathing altogether;
since their flesh and bones, like the dead bodies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
plants, go back to enrich their common dust. The bones
and bodies and shells of members of the animal kingdom,
however, are far richer food for soils than is dead vegetation.
The shell creatures of the sea to which we owe our
wonderfully fertile limestone soils are&mdash;many of them&mdash;so
small that you can only make them out with a microscope;
while certain other contributors to our food-supply were
so big that one of them, walking down a country road,
would almost fill the road from fence to fence.</p>

<h5>A STRANGE FACE IN THE MEADOW</h5>

<p>Now let's take a look at some of these
big fellows. How would you like to have
such a creature as the one at the right of
this page come ambling up to meet you at
the meadow gate of an evening when you went to milk the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
cows? Yet more than likely either this gentle animal, or
some of his kin, browsed over the very field where now the
cattle pasture, for he, too, was a grass-eater, and with an
appetite most hearty. If you kept him in a barn his stall
would have to be eighty feet long, and it would be necessary
to fill his rack with a ton of fodder every third day.
But, assuming there was a market for him in the shape
of steaks and roasts, you would be well repaid; for, in
prime condition, he weighed twenty tons.</p>

<p>These monsters who ate grass, and other monsters who
ate them, and still other monsters who lived in the sea,
appeared comparatively late in the life of the world.</p>

<p class="caption">NO WONDER HE NEVER WORRIED!</p>
<p class="ctext">Quite aside from the fact that he had so little brain to worry with, it seems highly improbable
that the Stegosaurus ever felt any apprehension about attacks from the rear, in the
frequent military operations which distinguished the times in which he lived. In addition to
the horny plates down his back he had those horny spines which were swung by a tail some
ten feet long.</p>

<h5>TONS AND TONS OF ANCIENT BONES</h5>

<p>It is only about 15,000,000 years ago, for example, that
the biggest of them all, the Dinosaurs, lived, while the
earth itself is now supposed to be some 100,000,000 years
old. Their numbers were enormous, and it is probable
there is not an acre of ground from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, and from Alaska to the tip end of South America
that has not been fertilized by their bones. In fact, of
certain species I have found the bones scattered all the
way from Oregon to Patagonia; so this must have been
their pasture.</p>

<p>They were not only all over the land, but in the lakes
and in the great sea that once extended right through
North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic
Ocean. And they were along the shores of the sea and in
the swamps. The bones of the ancestors of the whale
were found in such quantities in some of the Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
States that they were used to build fences until it was
found they were much more valuable to enrich the fields
themselves.</p>

</div></div>


<p>In the great American inland sea of those days swam one
kind of fierce fish-lizard that took such big bites he had to
have a hinge in his jaw. Because of this hinge he could
open his mouth wider without putting anything out of
place, don't you see? He was called the Mesosaur. But
he never bit the Archelon, who was in his crowd, because
he couldn't. The Archelon was the king of turtles, and,
like all the turtle family, wore heavy armor. He was over
twelve feet long. And sharks&mdash;no end of them! A shark
at his best is bad enough, but the sharks of those days
were almost too terrible to think about. Such jaws! And
teeth like railroad spikes! Then there was a great toothed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
diving creature with wings. They've named him the "Hesperornis,"
which means "western bird." He was given
the name because the fossils of the best-known species were
found in the chalk-beds of Kansas.</p>

<h5>THE EARLIEST RULERS OF THE SEA</h5>

<p>The first monsters, like the first of almost everything
else, including the land itself, were in the sea.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> For a time
giant fish, armor-plated like a man-of-war, and with awful
appetites, just about ran everything. Then came the reign
of the sharks. Some of them had jaws that opened to the
height of a door&mdash;six feet or over. Next in succession, as
rulers of the sea, were the fish-lizards, of whom that hinge-jawed
Mesosaur was one. Of another of these fish-lizards a
famous teacher of Edinburgh University, Professor Blackie,
wrote that funny verse at the head of this chapter. The
bones of this particular specimen were found sticking out
of a cliff at Lyme-Regis, a popular watering-place in the
English Channel, by a pretty English girl who was strolling
along the beach.</p>

<p class="caption">A FAMILY PARTY</p>
<p class="ctext">The imagination of the artist enables us to picture this family party&mdash;Mrs. Ichthyosaurus
and her children out for a stroll in prehistoric waters.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Ichthyosaurus, as Professor Blackie says in his
verse, was some thirty feet long, with a comparatively
large head&mdash;like an alligator's&mdash;set close to his body.
Another fish-lizard, well and unfavorably known by his
neighbors of the sea, was the Plesiosaurus. Instead of fins
he had big paddles resembling those of the seal. He was a
kind of side-wheeler, like the Mississippi River steamboats,
and he could go like everything! His neck was long and
he darted after the smaller creatures he lived on.</p>


<h5><a name="REIGN_OF_THE_LIZARD_FAMILY" id="REIGN_OF_THE_LIZARD_FAMILY">REIGN OF THE LIZARD FAMILY</a></h5>

<p>But these queer fish seem to have just been getting ready
to land; for, by being lizards, they after a while managed it.
A lizard, you know, belongs to the reptile family, and out
of these sea reptiles there grew, in course of time, reptiles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
which lived, not in the sea but in the swamps along the sea.
These reptiles were the Dinosaurs, and they are related to
the Minosaurs and the Ichthyosaurus, and the rest of the
Saurs, as you can see by the family name; for "saur" means
lizard. Dinosaur means "terrible lizard." Don't you
think he looks it?</p>

<p>Although some of these Dinosaurs were no larger than
chickens, others were by far the largest creatures that ever
were, on sea or land. Many of the biggest lived on grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
just like an old cow, while the flesh-eating Dinosaurs lived
on them. Some of these Dinosaurs went on all fours, while
others ran about on their hind legs, and when they stood
still, propped themselves up on their big, thick tails as do
kangaroos. The Camptosaurus, one of whose favorite resorts
was the land that is now Wyoming, was thirty feet
long. Another called the Brontosaurus, was sixty feet
long. The Atlantosaurus, one of the pioneers of Colorado,
measured eighty feet from the end of his nose to the end
of his tail, and all of them were built in proportion. The
Stegosaurus, also an early settler in Wyoming, had huge
bony plates, like ploughshares, sticking out all along his
back from the nape of his neck to the end of his tail. He
seems to have gone about looking quite ugly and humpbacked,
as our old cat does when she has words with the
dog.</p>

<p>After the swamps dried up and the lizards could no longer
make a living, came the reign of the mammals; including
the Mastodons and the Mammoths, marching in countless
herds, trumpeting through the forests.</p>


<h5>HOW SOME MONSTERS PLOUGHED THE FIELD</h5>

<p>But besides what they did in the way of fertilizing the
land with their flesh and bones some of the mammals did
a good deal of ploughing. Among these early ploughmen
were the Mastodons and the Mammoths, and another
elephant-like creature with two tusks, that he wore, not
after the fashion among elephants to-day, but curving down
from his chin, somewhat like Uncle Sam's goatee. He used
these tusks, it is supposed, not only for self-defense, but for
grubbing up roots which he ate. If so, they must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
been about as good ploughs as those crooked sticks that
were used by the early farmers among men, and that are
still in use among primitive peoples.</p>


<h5><a name="THE_ELEPHANT_FAMILY_AS_PLOUGHMEN" id="THE_ELEPHANT_FAMILY_AS_PLOUGHMEN">THE ELEPHANT FAMILY AS PLOUGHMEN</a></h5>

<p>What makes it more likely that the creature with the
down-curving tusks stirred the soil with them is that his
cousins, the elephants of to-day, are themselves great
ploughmen. Elephants feed, not only on grass and the
tender shoots of trees, but on bulbs buried in the soil, which
they hunt out by their fine sense of smell. In digging these
bulbs they turn up whole acres of ground. Elephants also
do a great deal of ploughing by uprooting trees so as to
make it more convenient to get at their tender tops. Sir
Samuel Baker, the explorer, says the work done by a herd
of elephants in a mimosa forest in this way is very great
and that trees over four feet in circumference are uprooted.
In the case of the biggest trees several elephants work together,
some pulling the tree with their trunks, while others
dig under the roots with their tusks. To be sure, the mimosa-trees
have no tap roots, but tearing them out of the
ground is no small job, nevertheless. It takes strength and
it takes engineering.</p>

<p>Another early ploughman was a bird, the Moa. The
Moa had no wings, but his muscular legs were simply
enormous, and so were his feet. New Zealand seems to
have been the headquarters of the Moas. There used to
be loads of them as shown by the huge deposits of their
bones. They are supposed to have been killed in countless
numbers during the Ice Ages in the Southern Hemisphere;
for there were Ice Ages in the Southern as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the Northern Hemisphere. In one great morass in New
Zealand abounding in warm springs, bones of the Moas
were found in such countless numbers, layer upon layer,
that it is thought the big birds gathered at these springs
to keep warm during those great freezes.</p>


<h5><a name="THE_MILLSTONES_OF_THE_MOAS" id="THE_MILLSTONES_OF_THE_MOAS"></a>THE MILLSTONES OF THE MOAS</h5>

<p>Besides the work they did with feet and bills you may
imagine how much nice fresh stone the Moas must have
ground up in their crops during the millions of years they
existed. It was a regular mill&mdash;the gizzard of a Moa&mdash;full
of pebbles as big as hickory nuts. Scattered about the
springs where their bones are found are little heaps of these
pebbles, each the contents of a gizzard. Like miniature
tumuli, they mark the spots where the bodies of the Moas
returned to dust.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of those flesh-eating Dinosaurs did a little
ploughing once in a while, too; for one theory is that those
ridiculous little arms were used for scratching out a nest
for the eggs, just as the crocodiles and the alligators and
the turtles dig nests for their eggs to-day. For all these
animals, as did the Dinosaurs, belong to the reptile family,
and show the family trait of digging out nests for their
eggs.</p>

<p class="caption">A PUZZLE PAGE FROM THE GREAT STONE BOOK</p>
<p class="ctext">Talk about your cut-out puzzles! Here is a specimen of the kind of puzzle Nature and the
course of things in the darkest ages of world history have cut out for the paleontologists.
It is a find of ancient bones in the asphalt deposits near Los Angeles.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Although the Dinosaurs roamed the swamps and lowlands
of all the ancient world, their favorite resort was the
territory now occupied by our Western States&mdash;judging
from the quantities of bones they left&mdash;while that old Mediterranean
Sea of ours was full of their kin, the sea-lizards.
Professor Marsh, of Yale, who was among the first explorers
of the graves of these monarchs of the past, says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that one day, while riding through a valley in the Rocky
Mountains, he saw the bones of no less than seven sea-lizards
staring at him from the cliffs. Yet, only here and
there by the wearing through of the rocks by flowing streams
has nature opened up these vast mausoleums, the mountains
and the cliffs. What enormous quantities of bones,
then, must still be buried there, what tons and tons must
have given their lime and phosphate to the soil. So you
see this story of old bones, even from a farming standpoint,
is no light matter.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="II_How_the_Monsters_Died_and_Returned_to_Dust" id="II_How_the_Monsters_Died_and_Returned_to_Dust"></a>II. How the Monsters Died and Returned to Dust</span></h4>

<p>"But you said these monsters lived in the sea and in
swamps. Then how, in the name of common sense, did
their bones get up into the mountains?"</p>


<h5>WHEN THE INLAND SEA WENT DRY</h5>

<p>Well, it's like this: As I said a while back, in the days of
the monster fish and the monster lizards, there was a great
sea reaching clear from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic
Ocean, and with swamps along the borders extending far
into lands that afterward became the Rocky Mountains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
When the land began to rise, due to the shrinking of the
earth&mdash;a thing that has been going on ever since the earth
was born&mdash;the sea and the swamps went dry, and far to
the west the land wrinkled up into the Rocky Mountains.
In these layers of rock that made the mountains were the
bones of the monsters that had died when the rocks were
still mud, in the swamps and along the borders of the
inland sea.</p>

<p>Not only did the land under the western portion of the
sea slowly rise until the waters were completely closed in
on the west, and the sea thus made that much narrower,
but the rise of the land on the south cut off connection with
the great salt ocean which surrounds the continents to-day.
So the salt-water fish, for lack of salt water, died, and with
them the monsters like the Ichthyosaurus that lived on the
salt-water fish that lived in this salt sea.</p>

<p>But it wasn't alone that the seas grew narrower and
more shallow because of the elevation of the lands. The
mountains rising in the west, cut off the rain-laden winds
which blew from the Pacific in those days just as they do
now. Thus the seas dried up so much the faster. But
first, before the sea went entirely dry, its place was taken
by the lakes and swamps into which it shrivelled up. Low,
swampy land is just what reptiles like, so this was their
Golden Age, just as the previous time of the wide, deep
sea was the Golden Age of the big fish and the fish-lizards.</p>

<p>Then, as the land still rose and the climate grew dryer,
the reptiles passed away, and in came the mammal family,
to which the cows and the horses and the cats and the
kittens, and all the rest of us, belong.</p>

<p class="ctext">Tigers like this lived ages ago in both the Old World and the New. They had canine
teeth, curved like a sabre, in the upper jaw.)</p>
</div></div>


<h5>TOO MUCH BRAWN, TOO LITTLE BRAIN</h5>

<p>Of course, even where they didn't die with their boots
on, so to speak, as so many of them did in those lawless
days, there came a time for each monster, in the order of
nature, when he drew his last breath. But what seems so
strange is that all these monsters&mdash;the biggest and strongest
of them&mdash;entirely disappeared and left no descendants!<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The whole of the mystery has not been unravelled yet,
even by the wise men of science, but still they have learned
a good deal. For one thing, they know that most of the
reptiles and the fish-lizards disappeared because so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the land where they lived went dry. They had to get a
new boarding-place, and there wasn't any to get! Another
thing was that these big fellows, although they <i>were</i> so big,
and got along finely while everything was just so, had so
little brain they couldn't change their habits to meet new
conditions, as our closer and cleverer cousins, the mammals,
did. Why, do you know that one of these monsters,
who was twenty-five feet long if he was an inch, and twelve
feet high, had a brain no bigger than a man's fist? All the
monsters of those days were like that&mdash;tons of bone and
muscle, but a very small supply of brains.</p>

<p>So when things went against them, they just had to
give up, and, like a queer dream, they faded away. But
their history makes one of the most interesting chapters
in the whole wonderful story of the dust.</p>

<p>Of all the live stock that have fed on the great world-farm
and helped enrich it with their bones, these animals
were surely the strangest that ever were seen!</p>


<p class="center"><a name="HIDE_AND_SEEK_IN_THE_LIBRARY_34" id="HIDE_AND_SEEK_IN_THE_LIBRARY_34">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"But since these monsters passed away many millions of years
ago, and all that is usually found is a piece of them here and there,
how do the men of science know so much about them&mdash;how they
looked, and how they ate, and how they treated one another?"</p>

<p>That's a good question. It <i>does</i> seem strange. Why, to hear
them talk, you'd suppose these men, learned in ancient bones, had
actually <i>met</i> the monsters! And, speaking of meeting them, I
must tell you a little story. It's a good story and it will answer
your question.</p>

<p>Baron Cuvier, one of the most famous of the paleontologists,
awoke from a deep sleep to see standing by his bed a strange,
hairy creature with horns and hoofs. And it said:</p>

<p>"Cuvier! Cuvier! I have come to eat you!" But the baron,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
taking in the form of the monster at a glance, only laughed.</p>

<p>"Horns and hoofs? You can't. You're a grain-eater!"</p>

<p>See the point? The baron argued that because the monster
had horns and hoofs he must be a grain-eater; for all creatures with
both horns and hoofs are grain-eaters. This particular creature,
to be sure, was an eater of both meat and grain&mdash;being one of
Cuvier's students who was trying to play a trick on him. But the
principle holds good. The scientists, <i>knowing</i> one thing, <i>infer</i>
another. Because animals with both horns and hoofs eat no meat
Cuvier knew his visitor couldn't eat <i>him</i>, even if he'd been real
and not just made up.</p>

<p>For another instance, take our queer old friend that Professor
Blackie wrote the funny rhyme about&mdash;the Ichthyosaurus "with a
saw for a jaw and a big staring eye." The scientists figure, just
from looking into the hollow socket where the eye used to be, that
he could see at night like a cat&mdash;and right through muddy water,
too; that he spent most of his time in shallows near the shore;
that it didn't make any difference to him whether a fish was near or
far, provided it wasn't too far, of course, for he could see it and catch
it, just the same. They also said&mdash;these learned men, after peering
into the dark hollow where that remarkable eye used to be&mdash;that Mr.
Ichthyosaurus spent a great deal of time diving and a great deal
of time with his homely face just above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Why they could reason all this from a hollow eye socket and
some bony, flexible plates around the outer edge of it, you will see
by referring to such books as "Animals of the Past," by F. A.
Lucas, director of the American Museum of Natural History;
"Creatures of Other Days" and "Extinct Monsters," by Hutchinson;
"Extinct Animals," by Lankester; "Mighty Animals," by
Mix; the chapter "When the World was Young," in Lang's "Red
Book of Animal Stories," and "Restoring Prehistoric Monsters"
in "Uncle Sam, Wonder Worker," by Du Puy.</p>

<p>Here are some more conclusions they draw from certain facts.
See how near you can come to reasoning them out for yourself before
looking them up in the books that tell.</p>

<p>Why it is supposed the Dinosaurs swam like Crocodiles. (Look
at the picture of Mr. I., and pay <i>particular</i> attention to his tail.)</p>

<p>Why it is they say that the sea-lizards with long necks must
have had small heads.</p>

<h3>THE WINDS AND THE WORLD'S WORK</h3>


<p>That saying "idle as the winds" must have started in
the days when they didn't know; for if ever there was a
busy people, it's the Winds.</p>

<p>Not only do they help plant the trees of the forest, sow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the fields with grass and flowers, and water them with
rain, but they make and carry soil all over the world.
And, like everything else in Nature, they have a sense of
beauty and the picturesque. Rock, for example, weathered
away into dust by the help of the winds, as it is, takes on
all sorts of picturesque shapes. And, of course, the winds
love music; everybody knows that. Before we get through
with this chapter we're going to end a happy day outdoors
with a grand musical festival in the forest, with light refreshments&mdash;spice-laden
winds from the sea. There'll be
nobody there but the trees and the winds and John Muir
and us; all nice people.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">I. Such Clouds of Dust!</span></h4>

<p>March leads the procession of the dusty months because
the warming up of the land, as the sun advances from the
south, brings the colder and heavier winds down from the
north. These winds seem to have a wrestling match with
the southern winds and with each other, and among them
they kick up a tremendous dust, because there's so much
of it lying around loose; for the snows have gone, and the
rainy season hasn't begun, and the fields are bare.</p>


<h5>ABOUT THE DUST WE GET IN OUR EYES</h5>

<p>Most people think these March winds a great nuisance
because some of us dust grains are apt to get into their
eyes; but dust in the eye is only the right thing in the
wrong place. Just think of the amount of dust going
about in March that <i>doesn't</i> get into your eye; and how nice
and fine it is, and how mixed with all the magic stuff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
different kinds of soil, thus brought together from everywhere.</p>

<p>An English writer on farming says he thinks the fact
that English farms have done their work so well for so
many centuries is due, in no small degree, to the March
winds that have brought us world-travelled dust grains
from other parts of the globe.</p>

<p>And the wind is a good friend to the good farmer, but
no friend to the poor one; for it carries away dust all nicely
ground from the fields of the farmer who doesn't protect
his soil and carries it to farmers who have wood lots and
good pastures and winter wheat, and leaves it there; for
woods and pastures and sown fields hold the soil they have,
as well as the fresh, new soil the winds bring to them.</p>

<p>Most of the fine prairie soils in our Western States owe
not a little of their richness to wind-borne dust. In western
Missouri, southwestern Iowa, and southeastern Nebraska
are deep deposits of yellowish-brown soil, the gift
of the winds. And, my, what apples it raises! It is in
this soil that many of the best apple orchards of these
States are located. And now, of course, the apple-growers
see to it that this soil stays at home.</p>

<p>But there's another kind of dust that deserves special
mention, and that's the kind of dust that comes from volcanoes.
Volcanoes make a very valuable kind of soil material,
often called "volcanic ash." It isn't ashes, really.
It's the very fine dust made by the explosion of the steam
in the rocks thrown out by the volcano. The pores of the
rocks, deep-buried in the earth, are filled with water, and
when these rocks get into a volcanic explosion, this water
turns to steam, and the steam not only blows out through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the crater of the volcano, but the rocks themselves are
blown to dust. This dust the winds catch and distribute
far and wide. Sometimes the dust of a volcanic explosion
is carried around the world. In the eruption of Krakatoa,
in 1883, its dust was carried around the earth, not once
but many times. The progress of this dust was recorded
by the brilliant sunsets it caused. It is probable that
every place on the earth has dust brought by the wind
from every other place. So you see if you happen to be
a grain of dust yourself, and keep your eyes and ears open,
you can learn a lot, as I did, just from the other little dust
people you meet.</p>


<h5><a name="THE_WINDS_AND_VOLCANOES" id="THE_WINDS_AND_VOLCANOES"></a>THE WINDS AND VOLCANOES</h5>

<p>But that isn't all of this business&mdash;this partnership&mdash;between
the volcanoes and the winds. Did anybody ever
tell you how the volcanoes help the winds to help the
plants to get their breath? It's curious. And more than
that, it's so important&mdash;this part of the work&mdash;that if it
weren't carried on in just the way it is, we'd all of us&mdash;all
the living world, plants and animals&mdash;soon mingle our
dust with that of the early settlers we read about in the
last chapter. In other words, all the <i>plant</i> world would
die for lack of fresh air and all the <i>animal</i> world would
die for lack of fresh vegetables. So they say!</p>

<p>According to that fine system&mdash;the breath exchange between
the people of the plant and animal kingdoms&mdash;the
plants breathe in the carbon gas that the animals breathe
out; you remember about that. But the amount of carbon
gas in the air is never very large, and if there were no
other supply to draw on except the breath of animals and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the release of this same gas when the plants themselves
decay, we'd very soon run out.</p>

<p>Now this needed additional supply comes from the volcanoes.
Every time a volcano goes off&mdash;and they're always
going off somewhere along the world's great firing-line&mdash;it
throws out great quantities of this gas, and this also the
winds distribute widely and mix through the atmosphere.</p>

<p>And another thing: This carbon in the air helps crumble
up the rocks already made, and it enters into the manufacture
of the limestone in the rock mills of the sea. This
limestone will make just as rich soil for the farmers of the
future as the limestones of other ages have made for the
famous Blue-Grass region of Kentucky, for example.</p>

<p>All of which only goes to show how first unpleasant impressions
about people and things are often wrong. A
"dusty March day," you see, isn't just a dusty March
day. It's quite an affair!</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">II. The Dust Mills of the Wind</span></h4>

<p>But wind is not alone a carrier for other dust-makers;
it has dust mills of its own. The greatest of these mills are
away off among the mountains and in desert lands, but
after making it in these distant factories the winds carry
much of this fresh new soil material to lands of orchard and
pasture and growing grain.</p>

<p>Not long ago two of the professors at the University of
Wisconsin found a good illustration of what an immense
amount of soil is distributed in this way, and what long
distances it travels. Among the weather freaks of a March
day was a fall of colored snow that, it was found, covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
an area of 100,000 square miles, probably more. The color
on the snow was made by dust blown clear from the dry
plains of the Southwestern States, a thousand miles away.
The whole of this dust amounted to at least a million tons;
and may even have amounted to hundreds of millions of
tons, so the professors think.</p>

<p class="caption">TYPES OF NATURE'S SCREW PROPELLERS</p>
<p class="ctext">You can see for yourself (from the picture on the left) that long before man ever thought
of driving his ships through the water with screw propellers or pulling his flying machines
through the air by the whirligigs on the end of their noses, some flying seeds, such as those
of the ash here, had screw propellers of their own. And do you know that Nature also employs
the propeller principle, not only in the operation of the wings of birds but in the wing
feathers themselves? The two pictures on the right show the action of the wing and the wing
feathers when a bird is in flight.</p>
</div></div>



<h5>LITTLE MILLSTONES IN BIG BUSINESS</h5>

<p>For grinding rocks to get out ore, or for making cement
in cement mills, men use big machines, somewhat on the
style of a coffee-mill. These machines are called "crushers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
The winds, in their enormous business of soil-grinding,
however, stick to the idea you see so much in Nature,
that of using <i>little</i> things to do <i>big</i> tasks; as in digging
canyons and river beds, and spreading out vast alluvial
plains by using raindrops made up into rivers; in working
the wonders of the Ice Ages with snowflakes; and building
the bones and bodies of those big early settlers, and of all
animal life, and the giant trees of the forest out of little
cells. For, what do you suppose the winds take for millstones
in grinding down the mountains into dust? Little
grains of sand!</p>

<p>And with the help of the sun and Jack Frost it makes
these fairy millstones for itself. The outside of a big rock
grows bigger under the warm sun, in the daytime, and then
when the sun goes down and the rock cools off it shrinks,
and this spreading and shrinking movement keeps cracking
up and chipping off pieces of rock of various sizes. Up
on the mountain tops, among the peaks, the change of
temperature between night and day is very great, and even
in midsummer you can always hear a rattling of stones at
sunrise. The heat of the rising sun warms and expands
the rock, and so loosens the pieces that Jack Frost has
pried off with his ice wedges during the night.</p>

<p>Then also during periods of alternate freezing and thawing
in Spring and Fall, the rock is slivered up. These
changes in the weather as between one day and another
are due to the winds. In January and February, for example,
thaws and freezes are common. When the winds blow
from the south, the snow melts, water runs into cracks in
the rock and fills their pores; then a shift of the winds to
the north, a freeze, and the water in the crevices and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
pores turns to ice, expands, and breaks off more rock.</p>

<p>And what muscles Jack has! Freezing water exerts a
pressure of 138 tons to the square foot; so there's no holding
out against him once he gets his ice wedges in a good
crack. He sends huge blocks tumbling down the mountainside.
The larger blocks, striking against one another,
break off smaller fragments. The smallest fragments the
wind seizes. Others are washed down by the rains. The
largest, carried away by mountain torrents, bump together
as they thunder along, and so break off more fragments
and grind them so small that the wind can pick them up
along the banks when the torrents shrink, or in their beds
when these sudden streams go dry.</p>


<h5>RUNNING WATER AND THE WINDS</h5>

<p>In changing rock into soil, running water and the winds
each have an advantage over the other. Water weighs
a great deal more than air&mdash;over 800 times as much&mdash;and
so grinds faster with its tools of pebbles and sand. The
winds, on the other hand, get over a great deal more territory,
and they, like the lichens, understand chemistry.
Two of the gases they always carry right with them&mdash;carbon
dioxide and oxygen&mdash;help decay the rocks.</p>

<p>As I said, the winds do most work in dry and desert regions,
but when you remember that over a fifth of the
globe is just that&mdash;dry as a bone most of the time&mdash;you
see this is a great field. It has been so from the beginning,
for it is thought probable that there was always about the
same proportion of desert lands. Night and day the winds
have been busy through all these ages. Dust is carried
up by ascending air currents. Then the same force that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
keeps the earth in its orbit&mdash;gravity&mdash;pulls down on a
grain of dust. But its fall is checked by the friction of
the air. You see there's a lot of mechanics involved in
moving a grain of dust; and Nature goes about it as if it
were the most serious business in the world; handles every
grain as if the future of the universe depended on it. In
the case of sand or coarse dust, unless the winds are very
strong, gravity soon gets the best of it, and down the dust
grain comes to the ground again; then up with another
current, then down again&mdash;carried far by stiff breezes,
only a short distance by puffs&mdash;a kind of hop, skip, and
jump. But fine dust getting a good lift into the upper currents
at the start may stay in the air for weeks.</p>

<p class="caption">TO KEEP MOISTURE AND SOIL AT HOME</p>
<p class="ctext">In the broad fields of the West, where "dry-farming" is practised, they have these huge
machines. They are called "Cultipackers." They are cultivators with big, broad-brimmed
wheels that pack the surface of the soil after the blades of the cultivator have stirred it.
This not only prevents the moisture in the soil from evaporating as fast as it would otherwise
do, but keeps the winds from carrying away the soil itself.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In very wild wind-storms it has been figured out that
there may be as much as 126,000 tons of dust per cubic
mile; several good farms in the air at once, over every
square mile of the earth below!</p>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="III_The_Storm_Ploughs_of_the_Wind" id="III_The_Storm_Ploughs_of_the_Wind"></a>III. The Storm Ploughs of the Wind</span></h4>


<h5>TWO KINDS OF WOODEN PLOUGHS</h5>

<p>They use wooden ploughs, these winds, just as primitive
man did, and as primitive peoples do now; but not quite
in the same way, and the ploughing they do is much
better. For man's wooden plough is a crooked stick made
from the branches of a tree while the winds use the whole
tree&mdash;roots and all, and both on mountainsides and on
level lands the amount of ploughing they do is immense.</p>

<p>Almost all forests are liable to occasional hurricanes
which lay the trees over thousands of acres in one immense
swath. A large number of these trees, owing to their
strong trunks, do not break off but uproot, lifting great
sheets of earth. Soon, by the action of its own weight and
the elements, this soil falls back. The depth to which this
natural ploughing is done depends, of course, on the character
of the tree, but as it is the older and larger trees that
are most likely to be overturned, since they spread more
surface to the wind, the ploughing is much deeper than
men do with ordinary ploughs.</p>

<p>The result is that new unused soil is constantly being
brought to the surface; and not only this, but air is introduced
into the soil far below the point reached by ordinary
ploughing. The soil needs air just as we do; for the air
hurries the decay of the soil and its preparation for the
uses of the plant. The immediate purpose of ploughing
is to loosen the soil so that the roots of the plants can get
their food and air more easily. It also helps to keep the
fields fertile by exposing the lower soil to more rapid decay.</p>

<p>But here's the trouble: While the ordinary plough introduces
air into the soil for a few inches from the surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the subsoil, which is very important to the prosperity of
the plant, is practically left out of it, so far as getting needed
fresh air is concerned. The long roots of the trees that,
among other things opened for it channels to the air, are
gone. The burrowing animals that used to loosen up the
earth, man has driven away. More than that, the foot of
the plough which has to press heavily on the subsoil in
order to turn the furrow, smears and compacts the earth
into a hard layer, which shuts out the air, and also&mdash;to a
certain extent&mdash;the water from the lower levels.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei059" name="imagei059"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HOW THE SOIL GETS ITS BREATH</p>
<p class="ctext">Plants must have air to breathe, both above and below the soil, and the microscope is showing
us here how a sandy loam allows the air to reach the roots.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In mountain regions these "storm ploughs," as we may
call them, not only help to renew and prepare the soil in
the valleys, but are a part of the machinery of delivery of
new soil from mountain to valley. When trees on the
mountainside are overturned, they not only bring up the
soil, which the mountain rains quickly carry to the valleys,
but the roots having penetrated&mdash;as they always do&mdash;into
the crevices of the rocks, bring up stones already partly
decayed by the acids of the roots. These stones, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
roots die, decay and so release their hold, and also go
tumbling down toward the valley.</p>

<p>Consider how much of this storm-ploughing must be
done in the forests of the world in a single year, and that
this has been going on ever since trees grew big on the
face of the earth. In a storm in the woods of California,
Muir heard trees falling at the rate of one every two or
three minutes. And, as I said, it is precisely the trees that
can do the most ploughing&mdash;the older and larger trees&mdash;that
are most apt to go down before the wind. Younger
trees will bend while older and stiffer trees hold on to the
last. Before a mountain gale, pines, six feet in diameter,
will bend like grass. But when the roots, long and strong
as they are, can no longer resist the prying of the mighty
lever&mdash;the trunk with its limbs and branches&mdash;swaying in
the winds, down go the old giants with crashes that shake
the hills. After a violent gale the ground is covered thick
with fallen trunks<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> that lie crossed like storm-lodged wheat.</p>

<p>There are two trees, however, Muir says, that are never
blown down so long as they continue in good health. These
are the juniper and dwarf pine of the summit peaks.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Their stout, crooked roots grip the storm-beaten ledges like
eagle's claws, while their lithe, cord-like branches bend round
completely, offering but slight holds for winds, however violent."</p></blockquote>


<h5>AT THE STORM FESTIVAL WITH MR. MUIR</h5>

<p>Trees were among Muir's best friends, and he spent a
large part of his life chumming with them. What do you
think that man did once? He was always doing such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
things. He climbed a tree in a terrific gale so that he
could see right into the heart of the storm and watch
everything that was going on. Just hear him tell about it:</p>

<blockquote><p>"After cautiously casting about I made choice of the tallest of
a group of Douglas spruces that were growing close together like
a tuft of grass, no one of which seemed likely to fall unless the rest
fell with it. Being accustomed to climb trees in making botanical
studies, I experienced no difficulty in reaching the top of this one,
and never before did I enjoy so noble an exhilaration of motion."</p></blockquote>

<p>And such odors! These winds had come all the way
from the sea, over beds of flowers in the mountain meadows
of the Sierras; then across the plains and up the foot-hills
and into the piny woods "with all the varied incense
gathered by the way."</p>

<p class="caption">THREE KINDS OF SEED THAT THE WIND SHAKES FREE</p>
<p class="ctext">Here are three kinds of seed adapted for dispersal by the shaking action of the wind.</p>
</div></div>


<p>Though comparatively young, these trees&mdash;the one Mr.
Muir climbed into and its neighbors&mdash;were about 100 feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
high, and "their lithe, brushy tops were rocking and swirling
in wild ecstasy." In its greatest sweeps the top of
Muir's tree described an arc of from twenty to thirty degrees,
but he felt sure it wouldn't break, and so he proceeded
to take in the great storm show.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Now my eye roved over the piny hills and dales as over fields
of waving grain, and felt the light running in ripples across the
valleys from ridge to ridge, as the shining foliage was stirred by
the waves of air. Oftentimes these waves of reflected light would
break up suddenly into a kind of beaten foam and finally disappear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
on some hillside, like sea waves on a shelving shore."</p></blockquote>

<p>This was his impression of the forest as a whole, a dark
green sea of tossing waves. But if we study trees as long
and lovingly as Muir did, we can pick out the different
members of the family a mile away&mdash;even several miles
away&mdash;by their gestures, their style of grave and graceful
dancing in the wind.</p>

<p>Muir especially mentions the sugar-pines as interpreting
that storm to him. They seemed to be roused by the
wildest bursts of the wind music to a "passionate exhilaration,"
as if saying "<i>Oh</i>, what a glorious day this is!"</p>

<p>This was the picture part of it&mdash;the glorious moving-picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
show. Now listen to some of the music:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The sounds of the storm corresponded gloriously with the wild
exuberance of light and motion. The profound bass of the naked
branches and boles booming like waterfalls, the quick, tense vibrations
of the pine-needles, now rising to a shrill, whistling hiss, now
falling to a silky murmur. The rustling of laurel groves in the
dells, and the keen metallic click of leaf on leaf&mdash;all this was heard
in easy analysis when the attention was calmly bent.</p>

<p>"Even when the grand anthem had swelled to its highest pitch I
could distinctly hear the varying tones of individual trees&mdash;spruce,
fir, pine, and oak&mdash;and even the infinitely gentle rustle of the
withered grasses at my feet."</p></blockquote>

<p>When the winds began to fall and the sky to clear, Muir
climbed down and made his way back home.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The storm tones died away, and turning toward the east I
beheld the countless hosts of the forests hushed and tranquil,
towering above one another on the slopes of the hills like a devout
audience. The setting sun filled them with amber light, and
seemed to say while they listened:</p>

<p class="center">
"'My peace I give unto you.'"<br />
</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</p>

<blockquote><p>Did you know that the ash and maple seeds actually have screw
propellers, like a ship, so that they can ride on the wind? Pettigrew's
great work, "Design in Nature," makes this very plain,
both in word and picture.</p>

<p>In what way does the wind help to <i>produce</i> the seed of grasses
as well as carry and plant them? (Any encyclopædia or botany
will tell you how plants are fertilized.)</p>

<p>How could a tempest that blew down a tree help its seeds to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
a start? Wallace, in his "World of Life," says that on a full-grown
oak or beech there may be 100,000 seeds that are thus given a
better chance of life.</p>

<p>Speaking of "wind ploughs," what is the object of ploughing
anyway? The article on preparing the seed bed in "The Country
Life Reader" tells about what ploughing means to the soil and also:</p>

<p>Why good soil takes up more room than poor.</p>

<p>Why it is a good thing to plough deep, but a bad thing, if you
don't do it just right.</p>

<p>And farther on there is a most inspiring poem about the history
of the plough from the days of early Egypt to the present. It

<p>The deserts have helped to make western China fertile. How
did they do it? (Look at your geography map and remember that
the prevailing winds of the world are westerly.)</p>

<p>You'll find many interesting things about the winds and the soil
in Keffer's "Nature Studies on the Farm" and Shaler's "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18562">Outlines of Earth's History</a>." Shaler's "Man and the Earth" says a single
gale may blow away more soil from an unprotected field than could
be made in a geological age, and an hour's rain may carry off more
than would pass away in a thousand years if the land were in its
natural state. He also tells what to do to prevent the best part
of ploughed fields from being carried off by the wind.</p>

<p>Have you any idea how far seed may be carried by a hurricane?
Wallace, in his "Darwinism" deals with this question, and it's
very important in the story of the earth. Beal's admirably written
and illustrated little book on "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26158">Seed Dispersal</a>." tells a world of
interesting things about the wind as a sower. For instance:</p>

<p>How pigweed seeds are built so that wind can help them toboggan
on snow or float on water;</p>

<p>How wind and water work together in the distribution of seeds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>About seeds that ride in an ice-boat;</p>

<p>About the monoplane of the basswood;</p>

<p>About the "flail" of the buttonwood, and how the wind helps
it to whip out the seeds; and how the seeds then open their parachutes.</p>

<p>Dandelions go through quite a remarkable process in preparing
for flight. I wonder if you have ever noticed it. Before the seeds
get ripe Mother Dandelion blankets them at night and puts a rain-cloak
on them on rainy days, and just won't let them get out, as
shown on page 51. And do you know how she opens the flowers
for the bees on sunshiny days?</p>

<p>There is no island, no matter how remote, that isn't supplied
with insects. How do you suppose they get there? You may be
sure the wind has something to do with it or I wouldn't mention
the subject at the end of this chapter. (Wallace: "Darwinism.")</p></blockquote>

<h5>HOW RAIN GOES UP BEFORE IT COMES DOWN</h5>

<p>It's this way: You remember how you can "see your
breath," as we say, on a cold morning? Well, that's because
the moisture in your breath is condensed by the cold.
Now as the waters of the earth&mdash;the seas, lakes, rivers,
ponds, and so on&mdash;are warmed by the sun, the air above
them is filled with moisture, for the heating of the air
causes it to expand and draw in moisture from the water
like a sponge. Expansion makes it lighter also, and it
rises. Rising, it turns cooler, and the moisture condenses
and comes down as rain. Mountains usually have clouds
around them because moist air striking the mountainside
is driven up the slope, cooling as it rises. So rain and snow
fall often in mountain regions, and that's why so many
rivers rise in mountains. The moist air is also condensed
when it meets other and cooler air currents. But right
here is where the work of the dust comes in. For to make
rain you've got to have clouds, and clouds are due to this
moisture collecting around the little particles of dust of
which the air is full. When these little motes of matter
become cooler than the air that touches them the moisture
in the air condenses into a film of water around them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Fairy worlds with fairy oceans floating in the sky!</p>

<p>Each of these baby worlds is falling toward the big
world below. But very slowly; only a few feet a day, so
that even if nothing happened it might be months&mdash;yes,
years&mdash;before it would come to the ground, even in still
air. But when air is very thick with moisture the water
films on these dust particles grow rapidly, and thus increasing
in weight, they fall faster and faster, and finally
strike the earth as raindrops.</p>

<p>But here's another thing that helps. On the way down
two or more raindrops, falling in with each other, will go
into partnership&mdash;melt into one&mdash;and then they hurry
down so much the faster. That's why the sky grows darker
and darker just before a rain, and why the lower part of a
rain-cloud is the darkest: the little raindrops are forming
into bigger raindrops as they fall.</p>


<h5><a name="THE_LITTLE_ARTISTS_THAT_SHAPE_THE_CLOUDS" id="THE_LITTLE_ARTISTS_THAT_SHAPE_THE_CLOUDS">THE LITTLE ARTISTS THAT SHAPE THE CLOUDS</a></h5>

<p>But the shapes of clouds are supposed to be due to another
thing, the mysterious force we call electricity, and
that other mysterious force we call gravity. Just as the
worlds attract each other by gravity so these raindrops&mdash;or
dust grains growing into raindrops&mdash;are drawn toward
one another. Here's where Electricity steps in. These
rain particles are full of electricity and when two of these
electrified particles meet in the air&mdash;unless they strike one
another in falling, in which case, as I said a moment ago,
they blend into one&mdash;they get very close together and yet
keep dancing around one another without touching! It
is this dancing about that makes all those strange and
beautiful and ever-changing forms in the vast picture-gallery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of the sky.</p>

<p>Of course the wind currents help to change these shapes,
but I'm talking about the original designs.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">II. The Raindrops and the River Mills</span></h4>

<p>So much for the dust that helps make raindrops; now
for the raindrops that help make dust. This the raindrops
do in several ways. Falling on big rocks or decaying pebbles,
for example, they pound loose with their patter,
patter, patter, any little bits of soil and grains of sand that
have been made by the other soil makers&mdash;the sun, the
wind, the lichens, the chemists of the air, and so on. This
soil and these sand particles, if there is already any depth
of earth there, they carry down into the ground. Some
of this soil, with various stops and mixings with other
soils on the way, finally reaches the sea, where it helps to
make the rich limestone soils for the Kentuckies of millenniums
yet to be, by supplying food for sea creatures and
lime for their shells. For these shells become limestone
when the shell-fish are through with them. Mother Nature,
in addition to feeding her big, hungry families of
to-day in the plant and animal world, is always laying by
something for the future. But before it gets back to the
sea, by far the greatest part of the ground-up soil the rivers
carry is spread out in the lowlands in those "alluvial
plains" your geography tells about and that make a large
proportion of the fertile farms of the world. If the raindrops
fall on comparatively barren rock&mdash;in the mountains,
say&mdash;they carry some of this fresh soil to the mountain valleys
below, and some of it they may spread in bottom-lands
a thousand miles away, where the new soil helps feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the plants. The sand grains in it not only help the soil to
get its breath by making little air spaces, but these sand
grains themselves slowly decay and so make more soil.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei071" name="imagei071"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i071.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WHAT IRRIGATION DOES FOR DESERTS</p>
<p class="ctext">It is such land as this, in the arid regions of the West, that irrigation converts from a
desert to a garden of abundance. The soil is rich in all the substances that plant life needs.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But it isn't alone that they carry away the soil already
made and bury the sand grains. Some of the raindrops
soak into cracks in stones and dissolve the material that
binds the rock particles together, and so get them ready
to give way under the fairy hammers of the next shower
that comes along.</p>

<p>After Nature finally gets an original waste of barren
rock all nicely set with grass and flowers and trees and
things, the raindrops help to make soil in still another way.
Soaking through the decaying leaves, they pick up acids
which are just the thing for eating into rock and crumbling
it into soil. To be sure, the water soaking into the soil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and coming out of springs carries some plant food away
with it; but it takes it to lands farther down the river valleys,
and more than makes up for what it carries away by
the new soil made by its acids from the rocks, as it soaks
into their pores and runs among the cracks.</p>


<h5><a name="HOW_RAINDROPS_MANAGE_TO_GRIND_UP_THE_ROCKS" id="HOW_RAINDROPS_MANAGE_TO_GRIND_UP_THE_ROCKS">HOW RAINDROPS MANAGE TO GRIND UP THE ROCKS</a></h5>

<p>Moreover, raindrops actually grind up rocks. In order
to do this a lot of raindrops have to get together, to be
sure, and become rivers; but after all it's the raindrops
that do it. There'd never be any rivers if it weren't for
the rains and, of course, the snows.</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, the rivers, besides running other people's
mills, have mills of their own; and millstones. Most of
these stones originally came from mountains and were
brought into the milling business by mountain streams,
with the help of Jack Frost. For the frost not only pries
stones from the mountains and so sends them tumbling
down the slopes, but it keeps edging them along and edging
them along, farther down, after they have fallen. You'd
hardly think that, would you? Yet it's simple enough.
The water in the pores of the rock expands when it freezes
and that makes the whole rock expand, for the time being.
Then when the frozen water in the rock pores thaws out,
the rock contracts, and this spreading out and pulling together,
small as it is, causes the rock to keep hitching along
down the incline; oh, say a fraction of an inch a year.
But still, in the course of the ages, these inches foot up,
and after a while this tortoise-like gait lands the stone&mdash;lands
tens of thousands of such stones&mdash;in the beds of the
mountain torrents that run along at the bottom of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
inclines. There they get ground together and so grind
out more soil material, particularly when the floods are on,
with the melting of the snows in spring and the falling of
the heavy and frequent rains.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei073" name="imagei073"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i073.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN OLD RIVER MILL</p>
<p class="ctext">It used to do a lot of business&mdash;this old river mill. Its grist was ground-up rock that
helped make fine farming land in the bottoms along the river's course. Such mills, called
"pot holes," are found in the rocky floors of rapid streams, where the eddying current or the
water of a waterfall wears depressions in the bed. Into these depressions stones are washed,
and then by the whirl of the flowing water kept going round and round, grinding themselves
away and grinding out the sides and bottom of the mill.</p>
</div></div>


<p>Another curious thing is how the river mills help themselves
to new millstones when they need them. If a river
hasn't enough for its work, it has a way of drawing on its
banks for more. Whenever the stones in its bed get scarce,
so that it can make comparatively little new soil&mdash;having
so few stones to grind together&mdash;it proceeds to dig its own
bed deeper, since this bed is no longer protected by a
rock pavement in the bottom. This, of course, deepens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
its channel, and so adds to the steepness of the slope of its
banks. Then, owing to this increase in the incline of the
slope, more rocks tumble in, and the "milling business"
picks up again.</p>


<h5>THE GOVERNOR IN THE RIVER MILL</h5>

<p>But there may be too much of a good thing; the rocks
may come in faster than the river mill can take care of
them. Then the river bottom becomes so completely
paved over that the channel stops wearing down at all,
to speak of, and the river remains at the same level until
the rains and the wind and other workers have worn the
banks down and lessened the incline. Then, with fewer
and fewer fresh stones tumbling in, the river gets a chance
to catch up with its work.</p>

<p>It is this ground-up rock stuff of the mountain river
mills, made by the grinding of the running streams all the
way down, that has helped form the rich bottom-lands of
the Mississippi Valley. For uncounted ages, the water of
the Mississippi and its tributaries have been at work, and
by the time you get down into southern Louisiana you come
to the delta where this rich soil has been piled up for more
than 1,000 feet above the bottom of the old Mediterranean
Sea, that used to reach north and south across the country.</p>

Mississippi's floods, like those of Father Nile, enrich the bottom lands, but the river is apt

of acres of good soil and pours it into the Gulf. How to teach the Mississippi to work in
harness, as the Nile has been taught to do in recent years, is one of the problems which will

<h4><span class="smcap">III. How the Rivers Act as Bankers for the
Farmers and the Sea</span></h4>

<p>We speak of river banks and the kind of banks that
handle those promissory notes our arithmetics tell about
as if they were entirely different; and so they are, I suppose,
if one just looks at the surface of the thing. But if
we dig into the subject a little we shall see that they are
much alike in the fact that one of the principal businesses
of both kinds of banks is to make loans at interest. Men's
banks loan money, to be sure, while the river banks loan
pebbles, but if it were not for these pebble loans there
would be a mighty sight less money for the banks to loan,
or the farmer to borrow; and the way both banks do business
ought to be a good lesson to certain farmers I know,
who seem to think they can always be cashing checks on
their banks&mdash;the farm lands&mdash;by hauling away the crops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
without ever putting anything back.</p>

<p class="caption">WHERE THE RIVERS ACT AS BANKERS</p>
<p class="ctext">Here is a fine piece of bottom land, one of those "banks" where the rivers keep "checking
accounts" for the farmers and the sea; using pebbles for currency, as explained in this chapter.</p>
</div></div>


<h5>HOW THE RIVERS PLACE PEBBLES ON DEPOSIT</h5>

<p>The rivers make loans to the soil by depositing pebbles
in the broad bottom-lands along their banks, and then
draw interest by carrying along to other lands, from
time to time, some of the fine rich soil these pebbles help
make by their decay. And the river does this in regular
banking style, "checking out" the pebbles from time to
time, and then depositing other pebbles in their places.
Take the banks and bottom-lands of the Mississippi River,
for example. It has been estimated that it requires about
40,000 years for a pebble to make the journey to the Gulf
from the mountains of a tributary stream where it was
first broken from the rock as a sharp fragment.</p>

<p>The first part of the journey in the mountains is over
steep down grades, and so is comparatively fast, but as the
river gets farther from the mountains, the slope of its bed
becomes less and less, the onward movement is slower and
slower, and more of the pebbles stop to rest. In times of
flood they are carried far away from the regular channel
and spread over the wide flood-plain of the river. Then,
as the flood goes down, they are left buried there under a
coating of mud. So buried, they decay and enrich the soil.
Then the next flood that comes along sweeps the pebbles
with it&mdash;checks them out of the bank&mdash;but at the same
time carries away not only some of the soil richness which
these pebbles helped to make but the soil material made
by the decay of the vegetation these pebbles thus helped
to grow, such as the roots and blades of wheat and corn
and stubble and chaff left in the fields. That's the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
on the loan. Then, when the flood subsides, the pebbles
are again deposited farther along in the river's course,
but meanwhile the same flood has brought fresh deposits
of pebbles from up-stream, and these are left in place of
those taken away.</p>


<h5>RIVER BANKING AND HUMAN CIVILIZATION</h5>

<p>This banking business has been going on for ages and
is a very important part of the history of civilization.
Here and there along the sides of the older and larger river
valleys are found the remains of ancient plains. These
plains are now, many of them, quite a distance above the
level of the stream. This means that they were at one
time the bottom-lands of that same stream, but the stream,
as it dug deeper and deeper into its bed, grew narrower,
and so abandoned its old flood-plains. As savage man
gradually settled down and took to farming, he found these
bottom-lands, with their rich, mellow soil, just the thing
for his crooked-sticks and stone hoes&mdash;the only kinds of
ploughs and hoes there were in those days. With such
crude farming tools he couldn't have managed to scratch
a living on any other kind of soil. When the river floods
came along, all these crooked-stick farmers had to do was
to keep out of the way until the floods went down, and
there were their fields all fertilized for them, as good as
new, and they could go on for thousands of years working
the same fields without ever bothering their heads as to
whether they needed any lime or potash or nitrogen, or
anything; for they didn't. The river floods attended to
all that.</p>

<p class="caption">FATHER NILE AND THE MAKING OF EGYPT</p>
<p class="ctext">"Egypt," said Herodotus, "is the gift of the Nile"; and it is true so far as her fertile lands
are concerned. The ancients attributed the annual floods to the god of the Nile, as shown
in that statue of Father Nile in the Vatican. Below is a threshing scene in Egypt painted
by Gerome. The last picture, from a carving in the tomb of an Egyptian noble, shows how
they ploughed and sowed in the Pyramid age.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>So, in course of time, civilizations such as those of Egypt
and India and Persia grew up, and in further course of
time these civilizations spread into Europe, and finally to
the New World.</p>


<h5>HOW RIVER BANKS GO BANKRUPT</h5>

<p>Now all this is very well, this leaving it to Nature to fertilize
the fields, where everything is just right for it, as it
is along the Nile, but in most lands it won't do it all.
The trouble is that, in raising the grain foods, the ground
must be kept free of grass and weeds, and well ploughed
during the rainy season. But the same rains that water
the fields wash more or less good soil into the streams;
much more than Nature alone can put back. For instance,
down in Italy where, if the old forests were still there, the
rains wouldn't wash away more than a foot of soil in 5,000
years, this soil is being carried into the Po, and by the
Po emptied into the sea so fast&mdash;a foot in less than 1,000
years&mdash;that if you visit Italy to-day, say, and then go back
in ten years, you'll see bare rocks on many a hillside that
is now clothed in green. On such rocks the soil is already
thin, and in ten years more it is all gone; all washed
away! This thing is going on all around the shores of the
Mediterranean. You are constantly coming on sections
of country that used to be covered with great forests and
prosperous farming communities where the soil has vanished,
and many stretches of barren, rocky land where
hardly a weed can find a foothold.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei081" name="imagei081"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i081.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">WHAT HAPPENS TO THE LAND WHEN THE TREES ARE GONE</p>
<p class="ctext">Could anything be more desolate? You can see from this example how vital to our
national life is the forest conservation work of our government. Trees, by the network of
their roots, keep the soil from washing away, retain moisture by their shade, and absorb the
water of the rains and the melting snows so that it reaches the rivers and the creeks gradually.
But when the trees are gone the water, unchecked, rushes down the slopes in floods,
washing away the precious soil and leaving them as barren as a desert.</p>
</div></div>

<p>"But, what are you going to do about it?" you say. "You
can't change the slope of the hills, can you? And the farmer
has <i>got</i> to plough his land&mdash;you just said so yourself."</p>

<p>Yes, he's got to plough his land, to be sure; but so has
he got to have pasture for his live stock. If he hasn't any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
live stock, that just shows what kind of a farmer he is.
Every farmer ought to have live stock. Corn always brings
a great deal more when it goes to market "on four feet,"
as the saying is; and, besides, the live stock give back to
the fields, in the shape of manure, a large part of what they
eat. Now, if you have live stock you must have pasture,
and all land with a slope of more than one foot in thirty
should be used partly for pasture and partly to grow wood
for the kitchen stove, and hickory-nuts and walnuts for
winter firesides. Although the land slopes, the mat made
by the grass roots will keep it from washing away.</p>

<p>"But suppose you lived where there wasn't any land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
to speak of that didn't tip up; in New England, say&mdash;what
would you do then?"</p>

<p>Leave the upper part of the slopes in the woods. Then
the water that carries off the soil will not run entirely
away, as it does in ploughed fields, but will creep down
slowly, and, charged with the decay of the woods, help
fertilize the lower lands and change the rocks beneath
them into soil&mdash;the acids from the decaying vegetable
matter eating into them.</p>

<p>"But still," you say, "there are farm lands that must be
ploughed even if they do wash away; they're all the land
a man has, sometimes. What then?"</p>

<p>Plough deep. Then the soil soaks up more of the rain
and lets the water pass away in clear springs. This not
only saves soil but, as we have just said, helps to decompose
the subsoil and the bed rock.</p>

<p>Then there's another thing that good farmers do in such
cases. They plough ditches along the hillside leading by a
gentle slope to the natural watercourses; so the water of
the rains, instead of going down the hills with a rush, and
going faster the farther it runs&mdash;like a boy on a toboggan&mdash;is
caught and checked in these sloping ditches, and much
of the soil it contains deposited before it reaches the streams.</p>

<h5>SUCH SPENDTHRIFTS OF GOD'S GOOD SOIL!</h5>

<p>My, but it's a shame the way we've wasted soil in this
country. What spendthrifts! To start with&mdash;when the
country was first settled&mdash;there seemed no end to the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
land, and every one could have a good farm for the asking.
All he had to do was to make his wants known to Uncle
Sam and then go out and help himself. What happened
then? Why, what always happens? Easy come, easy
go. These pioneer farmers worked their farms for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
there was in them; didn't bother, many of them, even to
haul the barn manure into the fields. Then when the old
farm was exhausted they moved off to new lands and did
the same thing over again.</p>

<p class="caption">A HOME IN THE DESERT</p>
<p class="ctext">Doesn't look much like a home in the desert, does it? But it is&mdash;a lovely home in what
the old geographies called "The Great American Desert." In the Sahara oases are few and
far between, but modern irrigation engineering makes oases to order&mdash;thousands and thousands
of acres of them!</p>
</div></div>

<p>They ploughed on steep hillsides; they allowed gulches
to form, as they will quickly do on sloping ploughed land,
if you don't watch out; they cut away the timber. It's
easy in a hill country like the eastern part of the United
States to have all the good top-soil washed away in twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
years after the forests have been destroyed; the good soil
that it probably took 2,000 years to make.</p>

<p>Doctor Shaler<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> estimated that in the States south of
the Ohio and the James Rivers more than 8,000 square
miles of originally fertile land had, by this shiftless and
thoughtless way of doing things, been put into such a
state that it wouldn't grow anything; and over 1,500
square miles of this, actually worn down to the subsoil,
and even to the bed rock, so that it may never be profitable
to farm again&mdash;at least not in our time&mdash;no matter what
they do!</p>

<p>I knew a farmer with a small son to whom he intended
to leave the farm when he grew up, who did things like
that for twenty years. By the time the little boy was old
enough to vote, there was no farm to leave; all the good
part of it was gone.</p>

<p>Serious thing for that little boy, wasn't it?</p>

having left the parent shrub. First, they float down-stream, as

and in your books on botany and agriculture.</p>

<p>Russell's book on the soil tells how the ancient Gauls and Britons

England. It's just the reverse of the way Father Nile looks

<h3>WHAT THE EARTH OWES TO THE EARTHWORM</h3>


<p>Suppose father had a hired hand who would plough his
fields, fertilize them at his own expense, build his own
house, board himself, and for all this ask only the privilege
of living on the place, studying Botany, Geology, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Geometry, and enjoying the scenery.</p>

<p>"Where can I get a man like that?" I imagine father
saying.</p>

<p>"You've got him now," you might reply. "He's already
working for you&mdash;thousands of him, and has been working
for you&mdash;millions of him&mdash;for thousands and millions
of years."</p>

<p>We have all known him well from boyhood by several
names&mdash;angleworm, fishworm, earthworm. He also, as
you will find in the dictionary, has a nice long Latin title.
And it is particularly fitting that his name should be so
associated with antiquity, since he belongs to one of the
oldest families in the world; a family far older than the
Roman Empire itself, which his people long ago helped
grind back into the dust from which it came.</p>

<p>And, speaking of Romans, every few years Mr. Earthworm
does what Julius Cæsar did, captures the whole of
England&mdash;all the best parts of it&mdash;and then, unlike Cæsar,
gives it back to the English, made over again, better than
it was before, as you will see.</p>

<p>If you happen to be a high school boy you, of course,
know about a certain city of Worms and what great things
took place there once upon a time, but there are many
cities of worms on any good farm, and each has more inhabitants
than the famous city of Worms of history&mdash;something
like 25,000 to the acre; and, in garden soil,
50,000!</p>

<p class="caption">ANOTHER "CATHEDRAL OF WORMS"</p>
<p class="ctext">In the story of the Reformation in your history you will read of a certain Cathedral of
Worms and what took place there once upon a time. Here is a "cathedral of worms" as
interesting to the student of nature as that famous edifice is to the historian and the architect.
It is the tower-like casting of a big earthworm and was found in the Botanic Garden
at Calcutta. The picture is "life-size."</p>
</div></div>



<p>Did you ever notice how big boulders in a field are frequently
sunk into the ground as if dropped from a great
height? It is the earthworms that help sink them in the
course of their soil-making. They like the moist shelter
of the stones and burrow under them. Finally the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of the stones crushes the burrows, and so the stones sink
down.</p>


<h5>PIONEER LIFE AMONG THE EARTHWORMS</h5>

<p>Poor soil, as every boy knows, is a poor place to look
for fishworms. But you have noticed that the mounds
the worm throws up on such soil are larger than those on
rich soil. The reason is that the soil, being less nutritious,
the worm must eat more of it and, in so doing, pulverizes
and fertilizes it. But a menu of earth alone not being to
the earthworm's liking, undesirable regions have fewer of
these farmers working underground; and this, for the
same reason that these regions are sparsely settled on the
surface&mdash;it is so hard to make a living.</p>

<p>So the earthworms may be said to have a decided taste
in landscape. They don't care for desert scenery like
Gerome's picture of the lion's big front yard,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but they
are very fond of orchards where the soil is rich and leaves
are plenty. The pathways artists are fond of putting in
landscapes would also probably attract the eyes of earthworms&mdash;if
they had any, for the worms prefer soil a little
packed, as it is in pathways, because it makes more substantial
burrows. And, singularly enough, the worms also
like most the very thing that the artist emphasizes to lead
the eye into his picture&mdash;the border lines that <i>define</i> the
path. It is along the edges of a pathway that you find
most worms.</p>

<p class="caption">THE EARTHWORM'S TASTE IN SCENERY</p>
<p class="ctext">Two features common to both these pictures&mdash;the trees and the pathways&mdash;appeal to
earthworms as well as artists, for reasons you have learned in this chapter.</p>
</div>



<p>The earthworm, in addition to working over and fertilizing
the soil already made, actually helps make soil out of
rock. He does this in two ways: (1) With acids&mdash;for, like
the Little Old Man of the Rock, he is a chemist; (2) by
grinding up rock in a little mill he always carries with
him.</p>


<h5>HOW THE EARTHWORM COOKS HIS MEALS</h5>

<p>The earthworm's favorite diet is leaves and he has a
way of cooking them. It is not quite like our way of cooking
beet or dandelion leaves, but it answers the same purpose&mdash;it
partially digests them. In glands, in his "mouth,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
he secretes a fluid which, like our saliva, contains an alkali.
But the earthworm's alkaline solution is much stronger,
and when he covers a fresh green leaf with it&mdash;as he is
usually obliged to do in Summer when there are so few
stale vegetables, the kind he prefers, in his market&mdash;the
leaf quickly turns brown and becomes as soft as a boiled
cabbage.</p>

<p>Of course, there are always dead leaves in the woods,
and these, which even the cow with her fine digestive outfit
cannot handle, are a delight to the earthworm; for he
also has a much larger supply of pancreatic juice than the
higher animals, and this takes care of the leaves after he
has swallowed them. He swallows bit by bit; just like a
nice little boy who has been taught not to bolt his food.</p>

<p>The acids in the earthworm's "stomach," acting on the
leaves, help make other acids which remain in the soil after
it has passed through the earthworm's body and help dissolve
those fine grains of sand which make your bare feet
so gritty when mud dries on them. And, not only that,
but this coating of soil lying upon the bed rock hastens
its decay; for the earthworm's burrow runs down four to
six feet, sometimes farther.</p>

<p>Besides the soil he thus grinds up and fertilizes so well
with leaf-mould&mdash;what your text-book on agriculture calls
"humus"&mdash;the earthworm does a lot of useful grinding
in connection with the building of his house. He begins,
as we do, by digging the cellar; but there he stops, for <i>his</i>
house is <i>all</i> cellar! He makes it in two ways: (1) By
pushing aside the earth as he advances; (2) by swallowing
earth and passing it through his body, thus making the
little mounds you see on the surface.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<h5>THE EARTHWORM SYSTEM AT PANAMA</h5>

<p>A principle similar to his swallowing operations is frequently
employed in engineering; as in making the Panama
Canal, where dredging machinery dug out swamps and
pumped the mud through a tube into other swamps to
fill them up and help get rid of the mosquitoes.</p>

<p>In pushing the earth away the worm uses the principle
of the wedge, stretching out his "nose"&mdash;as you have often
seen him do when crawling&mdash;and poking it into the crevices
in the ground; much as the wheat roots poke <i>their</i> little
noses through the fertile soil the earthworm makes.</p>

<p>And, as in human engineering and the work of the ant,
the earthworm doesn't throw the dirt around carelessly.
He casts it out, first on one side and then on the other;
using his tail to spread it about neatly.</p>


<h5>THE TILING IN THE EARTHWORM'S HOUSE</h5>

<p>The walls of the earthworm's house are plastered, too.
At first they are made a little larger than his body. Then
he coats them with earth, ground very fine, like the clay
for making our cups and saucers, and for making the beautiful
white tiling on the walls at the stations of a city subway.
When this earthworm "porcelain" dries it forms a
lining, hard and smooth, which keeps the earthworm's
tender body from being scratched as he moves up and
down his long hallway. It also enables him to travel
faster because it is smooth, and it strengthens the walls.</p>

<p>The burrows which run far down into the ground, as
all finally do toward Autumn, end in a little chamber. Into
this tiny bedroom the worm retires during the hot, dry
days of August and there he spends the Winter&mdash;usually
with several companions, all sound asleep, packed together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
for warmth.</p>


<h5>AND RUGS ON THE FLOORS!</h5>

<p>Sometimes the Summer and Winter residences are quite
ambitious, several burrows opening into one large chamber
and each tunnel having two, sometimes three, chambers
of its own&mdash;like a fashionable apartment with its main
reception-room, and still more like the central sitting-rooms
in Greek and Roman palaces. And the earthworm seems
even to have some idea of mosaics, for it is the general practice
to pave these chambers with little pebbles about the
size of a mustard-seed. This is to help keep the worm's
body from the cold ground. In addition to the mosaic
floors the earthworms have rugs with lovely leaf patterns
like the Oriental rugs that are so highly prized; and, as in
the case of genuine Oriental rugs, no two patterns are alike.
These rugs are leaves which the earthworm drags into his
burrow, not for food but for house furnishing. When used
for house furnishing they are placed in the entrance-hall;
that is to say, they are used to coat the mouth of the burrow
to prevent the worm's body from coming in contact
with the ground. The mouth of the burrow, of course, is
just where it is coldest at night in the Summer, the time
of year when the earthworm spends a great deal of his
time in the front of his house. The surface of the earth,
you know, cools very rapidly after sunset and the dew on
the grass in the morning is so cold it makes your bare feet
ache. The worm requires damp earth around him because
he breathes through his skin and must keep it moist, but
at the same time he is sensitive to cold.</p>

<p>And to drafts. Ugh!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h5>PEBBLE-FORT DEFENSES AGAINST THE FOE</h5>

<p>So he is very careful to keep the front door closed. This
he does by stopping it up with leaves, leaf stems, and sticks.
He also protects the door with little heaps of smooth round
pebbles; but these pebbles are of a larger size than those
he uses for paving the floor of his chamber. Besides helping
to keep out drafts these pebbles serve another purpose.
As our ancestors, the cave-builders, barred the door with
boulders to keep out bears and other unwelcome callers,
so the earthworms are protected by the pebbles, to a certain
extent, from one of their enemies&mdash;the thousand-legged
worm. Because of these little forts, the earthworms
can remain with more safety near the doorway and enjoy
the warmth of the morning sun. (So we might have reproduced
Corot's "Morning" as a kind of landscape the
earthworm enjoys!)</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">II. The Mind of the Earthworm</span></h4>

<p>From all of which you can see the earthworm, for what
small schooling he gets, is a very bright boy! If we were
as bright, according to our opportunities, we would probably
have answered long ago such puzzles as the question
whether there is really anybody at home in Mars, how to
keep stored eggs from tasting of the shell, and other great
scientific problems of our day.</p>


<h5>WHERE MR. EARTHWORM KEEPS HIS BRAIN</h5>

<p>Just as we have little brains in the tips of our fingers,
the earthworms have brains in the ends of their "noses."
They have neither eyes nor ears, but, like that wonderful
girl, Helen Keller, they make up for the lack of these senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to a remarkable degree, by the development of the sense
of touch. They acquire quite a little knowledge of Botany,
for example. They not only know that leaves are good to
eat, but they know which is the "petiole" and which is the
"base." They always drag leaves into their burrows by
the smallest ends, because this makes it easier to get them
through the door. And it is not by mere instinct that they
do this. Supply worms with leaves of different form from
those which grow in the region where they live, and they
will experiment with them until they find just the best
way in which to pull them into the burrows. After that
they will always take hold of them so, without further
experiment. That is the majority of them will do this; for
earthworms are like other little people&mdash;all of them are not
equally ambitious or studious.</p>

<p>And the earthworm also knows something about Geometry.
Cut paper into little triangles of various shapes and
pretend to the worms that they are leaves by scattering
them near the mouths of the burrows. Then remove the
leaves with which the burrows are stopped. The worms
will pull in the slips to close the door and they will&mdash;most
of them&mdash;take hold by the apex of the triangle because
that is the narrowest point.</p>


<h5>THE EARTHWORM'S TASTE IN MUSIC</h5>

<p>So you see the earthworm is a very cultivated country
gentleman with his knowledge of Botany and Geometry,
and his taste for landscape. But this is not all. He also
has opinions about music. There are certain notes that
apparently get on his nerves. Put worms in good soil in
a flower-pot, and some evening when they are lying outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
their burrows set the pot on the piano and strike the
note C in the bass clef. Instantly they will pull themselves
into their burrows. They will do the same thing at the
sound of G above the line in the treble clef. Although they
cannot hear, they are sensitive to vibrations, and these
are carried from the sounding-board of the piano into the
pot. They are less sensitive when the pot itself is tapped.
The music seems to go right through them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<h5>WHY THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM</h5>

<p>Except in rainy weather worms ordinarily come out of
their burrows only at night. By early morning they have
withdrawn into their holes and lie with their noses close
to the surface to get the warmth of the morning sun. Then
the early bird gets <i>them</i>! The reason a robin cocks his
head in such a funny way&mdash;like a lord with a monocle&mdash;just
before he captures a worm, is not because he is <i>listening</i>,
as many people think; for the worm isn't saying a
word and he isn't moving, and wouldn't make a bit of noise
if he did move. The robin's eyes are on each side of his
head and not in the middle of his face like ours, so he must
turn his head in order to bring his eye in line with the hole
where he sees the tip of Mr. Earthworm's nose.</p>

<p class="caption">THREE EARLY BIRDS. FIND THE THIRD</p>
<p class="ctext">Don't they look happy&mdash;these two tow-heads? They are evidently going fishing in the
early morning. Another early bird&mdash;several of him&mdash;that we are saying a good deal about
in these pages is to be found in the can. Still another, the one at the bottom of the page, is
taking advantage of the earthworm's family habit of warming his "nose" in the early sun
rays.</p>

<p>And many people also believe that earthworms come
down with the rain. Even park policemen believe it. At
least, one said to me, in Central Park:</p>

<p>"In dhry spells ye won't see wan. But let there come a
little shower an' th' walks and the dhrives will be covered
wid them; like the fairy stones that fall wid the rain in
the ould counthry."</p>


<h5>DO EARTHWORMS COME DOWN WITH THE RAIN?</h5>

<p>The reason you see so many worms after a rain is that
earthworms like moisture, and the rain seems to make them
feel particularly good and breed a spirit of adventure. So
out of their holes and away they go! A rain is their shower-bath;
and you know how a shower-bath makes you feel.
The mornings when the earthworms are apt to be thickest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
are those following a comparatively light rain in early
Spring when the worms have recently awakened from their
long Winter nap. With the beginning of the rainy season
in the Fall, the worms also do a good deal of travelling
into foreign lands, but in both Spring and Fall you will
usually find more worms after a light shower than after
a long, heavy downpour. If the worms were drowned out
it would be the other way around, don't you see?</p>

<p>To be sure, you will often find dead worms in shallow
pools by the roadside; particularly after Autumn rains.
These are sick worms and the chill was too much for them.
But it's remarkable how low a temperature a good husky
angleworm can stand. A professor in the University of
Chicago, near which I live, tells me he has often found the
ground in the neighboring park covered with worms after
November rains when his hands, and those of the students
who were helping him gather them for study, were numb
with the cold.</p>

<p>And how much work do you suppose these farmers do
in grinding up and fertilizing the soil? In many parts of
England the whole of the best land&mdash;the vegetable mould&mdash;passes
through their bodies every few years, and they
are doing similar work all over the world.</p>

<p>They not only fertilize the earth by mixing it with the
leaves they eat and those that decay in their burrows,
but their castings help to bury fallen leaves and twigs and
dead insects, and they also bring up lower soil to the surface,
thus increasing its fertility. And by loosening the
soil they let in more air. Remember that roots, like people,
must have air.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">III. The Mill of the Earthworm</span></h4>

<p>For the grinding up of the earth and the leaves, the
earthworm has, as I have already said, a little mill that
he always carries with him. Do you know what a gold
mill is? Well, a gold mill is a mill that grinds up rock and
so grinds out the gold. The earthworm's mill, in a manner
of speaking, also grinds out gold, for it grinds the little
particles of stone in the soil, and this soil grows fields of
golden grain.</p>

<p>The earthworm's mill is his gizzard. This gizzard is
made and works very much like the gizzard of the chicken.
And like the chicken the earthworm swallows little stones
to help his digestion. So these stones, too, are ground into
soil.</p>

<p>Like the chicken's gizzard the gizzard of the earthworm
is lined with a thick, tough membrane, and it has muscles&mdash;such
muscles! There are two sets of these muscles and
they cross each other somewhat like the warp and woof of
the cloth in your clothes. The muscles that run lengthwise
are not so very strong, for all they have to do is to
help the earthworm swallow, but the muscles that run
around the gizzard are wonderfully strong. They are about
ten times as thick as the other muscles. One of Mr. Earthworm's
French biographers<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> calls these muscles "veritable
armatures"; that is, freely translated, "veritable hoops of
steel."</p>

<p>I said, in the second paragraph above this, that worms
swallow grains of sand and stones to help their digestions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
as chickens do. But the earthworm saves time, for he
takes the stones with his meals; just as some Englishmen,
fat old squires, when they get along in years, or for any
other reason are a little weak in their digestive regions&mdash;keep
pepsin on the table with the pepper and salt.</p>

<p>And&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;the earthworm actually makes
his <i>own</i> millstones sometimes! The chalk in the chalky
fluid of the glands that help him digest his meals frequently
hardens into little grains in grinding the food. It's almost
as if the saliva in our mouths, in addition to acting directly
on the food, also made a new set of teeth for us!</p>

<p>Suppose we had a stomach like the earthworm, wouldn't
it be fun? We could digest the biggest dinners at Thanksgiving
and Christmas and picnics and birthdays. We
could even eat apples without waiting for them to get quite
ripe. Haven't you done it to your sorrow? And no
stomachache and no mince-pie nightmares!</p>


<h5>WHY THE EARTHWORM NEVER HAS NIGHTMARES</h5>

<p>By the way, the earthworm, although he has his troubles
like the rest of us, never <i>has</i> nightmares. For one thing
he has that stomach<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and&mdash;a still better reason, perhaps&mdash;he
never sleeps at night. Like the moths and the bats and
the burglars and members of Parliament, he makes night
his busy day.</p>

<p>And, in other ways, while he is so much like the rest of
us worms of the dust, his life differs from that of most
people. For instance, he not only works by night while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
we work by day, and works underground while we work
on top, but he takes his vacation in the Winter while we
take ours in Summer. In that respect Mr. Earthworm is
like the millionaires at Palm Beach; for in Winter he, too,
goes in the direction we call south on the map&mdash;that is
to say <i>down</i>.</p>

<p>But, as you say, it takes all kinds of people to make a
world; including earthworms and millionaires!</p>


<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</p>

<blockquote><p>Who was that in Mother Goose that went a-fishing "for to catch
a whale"? Anyhow, there are fishworms so big that one might
suppose they were made for catching whales. How long do you
suppose they are, these big fishworms? A foot?</p>

<p>Pshaw! We have fishworms of our own a foot long. Two feet?
More. Three feet? More. You look it up in the article on the
earthworm in the "Britannica."</p>

<p>And how many kinds of earthworms do you suppose there are?
You will be surprised to learn.</p>

<p>Also, you will find that the earthworms have relatives who live
in the water all the time.</p>

<p>The article in the "International" tells why these modest neighbors
of ours don't come to the surface in the daytime. That will
be an interesting thing to know. Don't you think so?</p>

<p>And did you ever count an earthworm's rings? Other scientists
have. (All live boys and girls are scientists; they want to
<i>know</i>.) Try counting the rings of an earthworm and then compare
your figures with those given in the article in the "International."</p>

<p>How many hearts do you suppose an earthworm has? You will
find in the "International's" article they have a good many of
what are sometimes called "hearts," and how different the earthworm's
circulation system is from ours.</p>

<p>Does our saliva do for us anything like what it does for the earthworm;
and our pancreatic juice?</p>

<p>Compare the earthworm's method of digging his subway with
that of the armadillo. How do they differ in the way of using their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
noses?</p>

<p>Do you know how men dig subways; like those under New York
City and Boston, for instance? Books that tell about this phase
of human engineering and tell it in a very interesting way are "On
the Battle-front of Engineering" ("New York's Culebra Cut")
and "Romance of Modern Engineering" ("City Railways"),
"Travelers and Traveling" ("How Elevated Roads and Subways
Are Built").</p>

<p>Speaking of the earthworm's wedge and how he uses it, do you
know that all of man's complicated machinery is the result of only
a few simple mechanical principles combined; and that the wedge
is one of the most important? Look up "<i>wedge</i>," "<i>machine</i>,"
"<i>simple machine</i>," etc., in the dictionary or encyclopædia.</p>

<p>How does the earthworm's method of pushing his way in the
world with the end of his nose compare with the way a root works
along in the ground? (See <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>.)</p>

<p>The earthworm's neat way of disposing of the dirt he casts out reminds
me of how the beaver handles dirt when he builds a canal,
and the way of the ants in digging their underground homes.
(Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII</a>.)</p>

<p>We have little brains in our finger-tips just as the earthworm
has on the end of his nose. How much do you know about the
little brains scattered through our bodies (<i>Ganglia</i>)?</p>

<p>You see the simple earthworm is the A, B, C of a lot of things;
and even Mr. Darwin's famous book doesn't contain all there is to
be learned about him in books and in personal interviews with Mr.
Earthworm himself. A farm boy to whom the writer read the
story of the earthworm, when asked how he thought the worm
could turn in his burrow when it fits him so closely, said, "Why,
he turns around in that little room at the end of the hall," thereby
solving, as I think, a problem that puzzled Mr. Darwin, and which
he left unsolved.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE LITTLE FARMERS WITH SIX FEET</h3>


<p>I don't believe I've ever heard anybody say anything
against an angleworm; although not many people, even to
this day, I'll be bound, realize what a useful citizen the
angleworm is.</p>

<p>But now we come to a class of farmers that, as a class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
are positively disliked; farmers that nobody has a good
word for, that nobody wants for neighbors. The charge
against them is that, like the man in the Bible, they are
always reaping where they have not sown; always helping
themselves to other people's crops&mdash;bushels of wheat,
bushels of rye, tons of cotton, loads of hay and apples and
peaches and plums; and nice garden vegetables; and even
the trees in the wood lot. It is estimated, for instance,
that the chinch-bug helps himself every year to $30,000,000
worth of Uncle Sam's grain; while other insects make away
with 10 per cent of his hay crop, 20 per cent of mother's
garden vegetables, $10,000,000 worth of father's tobacco;
and the Hessian fly sees to it that between 10 and 25 per
cent of the farmer's wheat never gets to mill.</p>

<p>"Yes, and sometimes it's 50-50 between the farmer and
the fly," said the high school boy, who often spends his
vacation with a country cousin.</p>

<p>Then there are insects that injure and destroy forest
trees because they like to eat the leaves or the wood itself;
and some 300 kinds of insects that make themselves free
with other people's orchards.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">I. Considering the Ant</span></h4>

<p>But, as I said a few moments ago, it takes all sorts of
people to make a world; and as there are good and bad
citizens among men, so there are good and bad among
insects. Indeed there are so many useful insects that help
make or fertilize the soil by grinding up earth and burying
things in it, that even this chapter, which is rather long, as
you see, can't begin to tell about all of them. So suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
we give our space to a few by way of example, and then
look up others in other books in the library.</p>


<h5><a name="AMOUNT_OF_WORK_DONE_BY_ANTS" id="AMOUNT_OF_WORK_DONE_BY_ANTS"></a>AMOUNT OF WORK DONE BY ANTS</h5>

<p>First of all let us consider the ways of the ant (as the
Bible tells us to). The ant's work may be said to take up
where the earthworm leaves off. Mr. Earthworm, as we
have seen, is a little fastidious about the kind of land he
tills. Among other things, he is inclined to avoid sandy
soil, while the ants will be found piling up their pretty
cones of sand or clay as well as of black earth. And in
some soils the ants do more important work than the worm
that helped make Mr. Darwin famous. In the course of a
single year they may bring fresh soil to the surface to the
average depth of a quarter of an inch over many square
miles. This not only helps to keep the farmer's fields fertile
by adding fresh, unused earth, but enriches them by
burying the vegetation&mdash;such as leaves and twigs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
branches broken from dead trees by storms&mdash;so that it decays.
This burying of vegetation is the very thing the
good farmer does when he spreads his fields with manure
from the barnyard, or when he ploughs under the stubble.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei106" name="imagei106"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i106.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A HEAP OF GRIST FROM AN ANT SOIL MILL</p>
<p class="ctext">Something of an ant-hill, isn't it? It is a foot high and measures nearly three feet across.
You will find such ant hills in the Arkansas Valley in Colorado, where the photograph of
this one was taken.</p>
</div></div>


<p>Ants are very glad to do this for the farmer because it
isn't any extra trouble for them. Their little heaps of
fresh earth are thrown out in connection with the building
of their homes. The mining ants dig galleries in clay, building
pillars to support the work and covering them with
thatches of grass. The red and yellow field ants are the
masons. They first raise pillars and then construct arches
between them, covering these arches with the loose piles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of soil which we know as ant-hills. The carpenter-ants
bore their cells in the dead limbs of trees, and the wood
dust they make from them hurries on the process of returning
these dead limbs to the soil. One kind of carpenter-ant
covers its walls with a mixture of sawdust, earth, and
spiders' webs. An ant in Australia builds its home of leaves
fastened together with a kind of saliva. One kind of ant,
whose calling card among scientific people is Formica
fusca,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> adds new stories to old houses as the colony grows;
much as in the growth of cities and hamlets the buildings
grow taller with the growth of the town. Just as men do,
such ants first build the side walls and then the ceilings.
As if these ants are working under contract and must get
their job done by a certain time, two groups are employed
on the ceiling at the same time, each group working toward
the other from the opposite wall and meeting in the middle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei107" name="imagei107"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i107.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE DESERTED VILLAGE UNDER THE STONE</p>
<p class="ctext">If Oliver Goldsmith had been as much interested in ants as was the French "Homer of
the insect," Henri Fabre, he might have written of another kind of "Deserted Village," its
"desert walks" and its "mouldering walls." This is a deserted village of ants. The little
citizens that built it lived under a stone. When the stone was lifted it took the entire roof
off the place.</p>
</div></div>



<h5>THE ANT WHO DIDN'T KNOW HIS TRADE</h5>

<p>As you may suppose, this is real architectural engineering
and no place for amateurs. I once saw a foolish worker
starting a roof from the top of one of the side walls without
paying any attention to the fact that the other wall was
much higher. The result was he struck the middle of it,
instead of joining it at the top. Another ant passing, possibly
the supervising architect, saw what was going to
happen. So what does he do but stop and tear down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
other's work and build the ceiling over again!</p>

<p>"There! <i>That's</i> the way to put in a ceiling," he seemed
to say. "For goodness sake, where <i>did</i> you learn your
trade?"</p>

<p>Huber, the famous student of ants, saw two of these
wonderful insects do the very same thing.</p>

<p>Sometimes the situation is such that it is necessary to
build a very wide ceiling, so wide that it would fall of its
own weight unless supported in some way. Then what
would you do; that is, if <i>you</i> were an ant?</p>

<p>"Why, I'd put up pillars to hold it."</p>

<p>That's exactly what the ants do; they put up pillars;
but instead of using steel beams, as men do in this day of
steel, the ant architects make pillars of clay&mdash;build them
up with pellets, little clay bricks which they shape with
their mandibles&mdash;their jaws.</p>

<p>But the ants seem to have some of the methods of steel
construction, too; the use of girders and things. Ebrard,
a French student of ants, tells how, when a certain roof
threatened to fall, some Sir Christopher Wren of the ant
world used a blade of grass as a girder, just as Sir Christopher
in his day put in girders to support the roof of Saint
Paul's Cathedral, and as men use steel girders to-day. The
ant fastened a little mass of earth on the end of a grass
stalk growing near to bend it over; then gnawed it a little
at the bottom to make it bend still more, and finally fixed
it with mud pellets into the roof.</p>

<p>But here's something that will make you smile! You
have heard about the lazy man down in Arkansas with
the hole in his roof? You remember he never mended it
in dry weather because it didn't need it, and when it rained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
he <i>couldn't</i> mend it on account of the rain!</p>


<h5>RAINY-DAY WORK IN THE ANT WORLD</h5>

<p>Well, these <i>Formica fusca</i> folks are as different from
that Arkansas man as anything you could imagine. First
of all, being ants, they are anything but lazy; secondly,
they never put off needed work on their roofs on account
of rain. In fact, they <i>choose</i> the first wet day to do it. As
soon as the rain begins they build up a thick terrace on
the roof of the old dwelling, carrying in their jaws little
piles of finely ground earth which they spread out with
their hind legs. Then, by hollowing out this roof, they turn
it into a new story. Last of all they put on the ceiling.
You see the rain helps them in mixing their clay.
There are ants that build up vaulted viaducts or covered
ways, and they use clay for that.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
They make the clay by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
mixing earth with saliva. Some of these viaducts reach out
from the house&mdash;the ants' house&mdash;to their "cow" pasture.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei110" name="imagei110"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i110.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN ANT CARRYING ONE OF HER COWS</p>
</div></div>

<p>You know about how ants keep cows, little bugs called
aphids? The aphids feed on plants, and the clay viaducts
protect the ants from their enemies and from the sun in
going to and from the pasture; for this particular family
of ants doesn't like the sun. They make clay sheds for their
cattle, too. Here and there along the clay viaduct are large
roomy spaces, cow-sheds, so to speak&mdash;where the little
honey cows gather when they aren't feeding. Another
kind of ant builds earth huts around its cow pastures. The
large red ants (<i>F. rufa</i>), sometimes called "horse ants,"
build hills as large as small haycocks.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">II. The Termites and their Towers of Babel</span></h4>

<p>But speaking of big buildings, did you ever hear of a
skyscraper a mile high? Well the home of the six-footed
farmer I am going to tell you about now is as much taller
than he is as a mile-high skyscraper would be taller than
a man. The remarkable little creatures that build these
skyscrapers are called "termites." Termites are also
known as "white ants." This seems funny when we know
that they are neither "ants" nor are they white. The
young of the workers are white, to be sure, but the grown-ups
are of various colors, and never milky white as they
are when young. The termites were first called "white
ants" in books of travel because the termites the travellers
saw were the young people.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<h5><a name="HOW_TERMITES_ARE_LIKE_THE_ANTS" id="HOW_TERMITES_ARE_LIKE_THE_ANTS"></a>HOW TERMITES ARE LIKE THE ANTS</h5>

<p>The termites are really closer relatives of dragon-flies,
cockroaches, and crickets than of the ants, but they do look
a great deal like an ant, and they have many of the ways
of the ants. As in the case of ants, all the members of one
community are the children of one queen. The king lives
with the queen in a private apartment. Sometimes&mdash;as
with human royalties&mdash;the king and queen will have separate
residences, but the termite royalties always live in the
same house with their people; they are very democratic.</p>

<p>Some kinds of termites live in rotten trees, which they
tunnel into, and that is their contribution to soil-making;
while others build great, big solid houses of earth and
fibres, mixed. These houses are called "termitariums,"
and are six, eight, ten, even twenty-five feet high; fully 1,000
times the length of the worker. Think of a man five feet
high, and then multiply by 1,000, and you see you have
got nearly a mile!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei113" name="imagei113"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i113.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SKYSCRAPERS A MILE HIGH</p>
<p class="ctext">"Some kinds of termites build great, solid houses of earth and fibres mixed. These houses
are six, eight, ten, even twenty-five feet high, fully one thousand times the length of the
worker. Think of a man five feet high and then multiply by one thousand, and you see you
have got nearly a mile."</p>
</div></div>

<p>These termite skyscrapers aren't much to look at on the
outside, but inside they're just fine; they have everything
the most particular ant could want. For instance, the
termites are right up-to-date in their ideas about fresh air,
their houses being well ventilated through windows left in
the walls for that purpose. You can see the importance
of this fresh-air system when you know there are thousands
of termites under the same roof. They also have a sewage
system for carrying off the water of the rains. And a fine
piece of mechanical engineering the building of it is, too;
for these "water-pipes" are the underground passages hollowed
out in getting the clay to build the homes. The termites
build their homes with one hand and dig the sewer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
with the other, so to speak.</p>


<h5>THE THERMOSTATS FOR THE NURSERIES</h5>

<p>The termitarium has as many rooms in it as a big hotel&mdash;oh,
I don't know <i>how</i> many&mdash;and they are all built
around the chambers of the king and queen. Next to the
royal apartments are the pantries, a lot of them, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
are all stored with food. In the upper part of the termitarium
are the nurseries&mdash;many nurseries&mdash;for no one
nursery could care for any such numbers of babies as the
queen has. Between the nursery and the roof is an air-space,
and there are also air-spaces on the sides and beneath.
The nursery thus being surrounded by air, the eggs and,
when they come along, the babies are protected from
changes of temperature. It's the same principle that's
employed in making refrigerators and thermos bottles.
The rooms in which the eggs are kept are divided by walls
made of fragments of wood and gum glued together. This
mixture is a bad conductor<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of heat or cold. And so the
eggs are kept at an even temperature.</p>

<p>While we cannot see any of the termite skyscrapers in
the United States, because we have none of the species of
termites that build them, we can see a member of the termite
family. This is the common white ant that digs
into joists of houses. On the outside of these same joists,
and up in the attics of old farmhouses, if there happens to
be a broken window-pane, or some other hole through
which she can get in, you can see the nest of another
tiller of the soil, the wasp. The mason-wasps or mud
daubers are the most common. You will find their nests
on the rafters of the barn when you go to throw down hay,
or when you go into the corn-crib. They have all sorts of
fancies&mdash;these wasps&mdash;about their clay homes and where
to build them. Some build on the walls and some in the
corners of rafters, others prefer outdoor life. Some want
to live alone, others like society. What are known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
"social" wasps sometimes build their nests in tiny hollows
that they dig in the ground; others fasten their nests to the
boughs of trees. The work of these wasps, from the farming
standpoint, is useful not alone in grinding the soil, but
helping to supply it with humus; for their nests are made of
wood fibre, which they tear with their mandibles from gateposts,
rail fences, and the bark of trees.</p>

<img src="images/i115.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NESTS OF MASON-WASPS</p>
</div></div>

<p>The carpenter-wasp is both a wood-worker and a clay-worker.
He cuts tubular nests in wood and divides them
by partitions. We think we're pretty smart, we humans,
because we are always picking up ideas, but here's a
creature, no bigger than the end of your finger, who has
picked up an idea from the carpenter-bee, grafted it on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
native trade of clay-worker, and made himself as nice and
cosey a country place as you'd want to see!</p>


<h5><a name="ABOUT_THE_WASP_THE_FOX_AND_THE_BUMBLEBEE" id="ABOUT_THE_WASP_THE_FOX_AND_THE_BUMBLEBEE">ABOUT THE WASP, THE FOX, AND THE BUMBLEBEE</a></h5>

<p>Here's another example of the same thing, this spreading
of good ideas among the neighbors. It's about the fox,
the digger-wasps, and the bumblebee. The fox can dig
his own burrow when he has to, but if he finds somebody
else's that he can use, he just helps himself&mdash;provided, of
course, the owner isn't Brer Bear, or some other big fellow
that Brer Fox doesn't care to have any words with. In the
same way the digger-wasps make their own little burrows
if they are obliged to, but prefer to help themselves to ones
they find already made, although they don't drive anybody
else out. They simply take possession of holes left by field-mice.
The bumblebee does the same thing. The bumblebee
digs a hole a foot or more deep, carpets it with leaves,
and lines it with wax. Leading up to the home is a long,
winding tunnel. As Bumblebeeville grows bigger there
may be two or three hundred bees in one nest. As the
bumblebee babies keep coming and coming, the burrow
has to be dug bigger and bigger, to take care of them.</p>

<p>But the greatest of bee workers in the soil is the mason-bee.
You can get an idea of what a useful citizen the
mason-bee is when I tell you that one of the little villages
of one species sometimes contains enough clay to make a
good load for a team of oxen. Yet for all that, they might
have gone on with their work for years and years to come&mdash;just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
as they have for ages in the past&mdash;and people
wouldn't have thought much about it, if it hadn't been for
some boys.</p>

<p>One time, in a village in southern France, a school-teacher,
who was getting on in years, took his small class of
farmer boys outdoors to study surveying&mdash;setting up stakes
and things, you know, the way George Washington used
to do. It's a stony, barren land&mdash;this part of France&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the fields are covered with pebbles. The teacher noticed
that often when he sent a boy to plant a stake, he would
stoop every once in a while, pick up a pebble and <i>stick a
straw into it</i>! That's what it looked like! Then he would
suck the straw.</p>

<p>Well, to make a long story short,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> these pebbles had on
them the little clay cells of the mason-bee. Mrs. Mason-Bee
fills these cells with honey, lays an egg in the honey,
and when the babies come along&mdash;don't you see? In other
words, Mother Bee not only puts up their lunch for them,
but puts them right into the lunch! This makes it convenient
all around; for, like almost all insect mothers, Mrs.
Mason-Bee is never there after the babies come.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei117" name="imagei117"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i117.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MASON-BEE CELLS AMONG THE ROCKS</p>

</div></div>

<p>There were so many of these pebbles scattered over the
plain, and the bees that were building new homes or repairing
old ones flew so straight and so fast between the
pebbles and a near-by road that "they looked like trails
of smoke," as Fabre expresses it.</p>

<p>Now, you may well wonder why the bees flew clear over
to that road to get dirt to build their nests when there
was plenty of loose earth right at their own door-steps;
right around the pebbles themselves. Isn't that queer?</p>

<p>Well, here's something that sounds stranger still. Mrs.
Mason-Bee takes those extra trips because a roadway is
so much harder to dig in! It's not because she needs the
exercise, goodness knows&mdash;this busy Mrs. Mason-Bee&mdash;but
because the hard earth of the roadway makes the
strongest homes; that is, when she finally gets it dug out
and worked up. And here's another thing that will seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
odd at first; although the soil she thus works over must
be dampened before she can plaster it into the walls of
her home, she just won't use damp soil to begin with.
Nothing will do her but dust, and dust that she herself
scrapes from the roadway. The reason of this is that the
moisture already in the soil will not answer at all. She
has got to knead the soil carefully and thoroughly with
saliva, which acts as a kind of mortar. This saliva, of
course, she supplies.</p>

<p>And the dust she works with must be as fine as powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and as dry as a bone. Then it absorbs the saliva, and when
it dries it is almost like stone. In fact it's a kind of
cement, like that men use for sidewalks and for buildings
and bridges.</p>

<p>But this wonderful old teacher and his boys<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> found
that even this isn't all this little house-builder and house-keeper
has to think of. She must have dust that is really
ground-up stone! So she digs in the roadway where the
bits of stone in this stony soil have been ground to powder
and then packed hard by the wheels of the farmer's cart
and by the hoofs of horses and oxen drawing their heavy
loads. But what did Mrs. M. B. do for ground-up stone
in the long ages before man came along with his carts?
Mr. Earl Reed, who, beside being the distinguished etcher
of "The Dunes," is a close observer of nature in general,
tells me he has often seen a mason-bee gathering the
pulverized stone at the base of cliffs. Evidently the mills
of the wind and rain, that we have read of in previous
chapters, had Mrs. B's wants in mind too.</p>


<h5>BEING A MASON-BEE FOR A LITTLE WHILE</h5>

<p>Now, just to show you one more thing about Mrs.
Mason-Bee as a house-builder&mdash;how clever she is&mdash;let's try
something right here. Let's suppose ourselves&mdash;yourself
and myself&mdash;Mrs. Mason-Bees. We have got a home to
build for some baby mason-bees that will be along by and
by. Say we already know that we must use this stone
dust of the roadway, and that we must make our mortar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
not with <i>water</i> but with <i>saliva</i>. Here's the <i>next</i> problem:</p>

<p>Shall the mixing be done where the building is going up
over there? That's the way human masons do it. But
Mrs. Mason-Bee evidently thinks otherwise, for at the
very time she is prying up those atoms of dust with so
much energy, you notice she is doing her mixing. She
rolls and kneads her mortar until she has it in the shape of
a ball as big as she can possibly carry. Then "buz-z-z-z!"
Away she goes, straight as an arrow, back home, and the
mortar is spread where it is needed.</p>

<p>You see, after all, this is the best way. If she didn't
turn the dust into mortar before she started, so a good-sized
lump of it would stick together, she couldn't carry
much of it at a time, and it would be forever and a day before
she could get her house built. As it is, the pellets she
carries are of the size of small shot; a pretty big load, let me
tell you, for a little body no bigger than Mrs. Mason-Bee.</p>

<p>And remember, this goes on all day long from sunrise
to sunset. Without a moment's rest, she adds her pellets
to the growing walls and then back she goes to the precise
spot where she has found the building material that best
suits her needs.</p>

<p>In building a nest, the mason-bee, in going to and fro,
day after day, travels, on the average, about 275 miles;
half the distance across the widest part of France. All in
about five or six weeks, she does this. Then her work is
over. She retires to some quiet place under the stones,
and dies. As I said, she never sees the babies she has done
so much for.</p>

<p class="caption">SURFACE MOUNDS OF THE MASON-ANT</p>
<p class="ctext">There are mason-ants as well as mason-bees. This illustration shows the works thrown up
by some mason-ants that Dr. McCook found in a garden path one morning in May.</p>
</div></div>

<p>And although they are so stoutly built, the houses of
the mason-bees, like those "cloud-capped towers and gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
palaces" that Shakespere speaks of, finally go back
to the dust. But while one of these little mothers is building
a new home or repairing an old one left by a mother of
the previous year, you would suppose the fate of the world
hung on it; as indeed the fate of the world of mason-bees
does.</p>

<p>Scrape! Scrape! Scrape! With the tips of those little
jaws, her mandibles, she makes the stony dust.</p>

<p>Rake! Rake! Rake! With her front feet she gathers
and mixes it with the saliva from her mouth.</p>

<p>How eager and excited she gets, how wrapped up in
her work as she digs away in the hard-packed mass in the
tracks of the roadway! Passing horses and oxen, and the
French peasants with their wooden shoes, are almost on
her before she will budge. And even then she only flits
aside until the danger has passed. Then down she drops
and at it again!</p>

<p>But sometimes, the boys and the teacher found, she
starts to move too late&mdash;so absorbed is she, it would seem,
in the thought of that tiny little home over there among
the pebbles.</p>

<p>Poor little lady!</p>


<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</p>

<blockquote><p>Perhaps nothing in nature is more wonderful than an insect;
particularly when you consider that he <i>is</i> only an insect! So, of
course, whole libraries have been written about insects. Here are
a few of the most interesting books dealing with the subject:
Beard's "Boy's Book of Bugs, Butterflies and Beetles"; Comstock's
"Ways of the Six-Footed"; Crading's "Our Insect Friends and
Foes"; Doubleday's "Nature's Garden"; Du Puy's "Trading Bugs
with the Nations." This about trading bugs is an article in "Uncle
Sam: Wonder Worker," and tells how Uncle Sam "swaps" with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
other nations to get rid of injurious insects and bring in useful ones.</p>

<p>Grant Allen's "Sextons and Scavengers" ("Nature's Work Shop")
tells many curious things about the sexton beetles; how, by tasting
bad, they keep birds and things from eating them; why you will
always find an even number&mdash;never an <i>odd</i> number&mdash;of sextons at
work together; what they use for spades in their digging; why male
sextons bury their wives alive, and why there is reason to believe
that these weird little insects have a sense of beauty and of music.</p>

<p>The same essay tells about the sacred beetle of the Egyptians,
the insect that we know as the "tumblebug"; why first the Egyptians
and then the Greeks regarded this bug as sacred; and why
men and women wear imitation beetles for brooches and watch-charms
to-day.</p>

<p>But the greatest work on this famous beetle has been written by
the famous French observer Fabre, "The Homer of the Insect."
You will find this book, "The Sacred Beetle," in any good public
library. Among other things Fabre gives a very minute description
of the variety of tools used by the beetle; tells how two beetles
roll a ball;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> how they dig their holes; how they "play possum,"
and then (I'm almost ashamed to tell this) rob their partners!
How they wipe the dust out of their eyes; about a tumblebug's
wheelbarrow; why their underground burrows sometimes have
winding ways; why there are fewer beetles in hard times; about
their autumn gaieties; their value as weather-prophets, and how
Fabre's little son Paul helped him in writing his great book.</p>

<p>Allen's essay, "The Day of the Canker Worm" in "Nature's
Work Shop," tells many interesting things about the Cicada, the
locust that only comes once in seventeen years;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> about Lady
Locust's saw (it looks like a cut-out puzzle); about the clay galleries
the locusts build when they come up out of the ground; how many
times they have to put on new dresses before they finally look like
locusts; why, at one stage of the process, they look like ghosts,
and how they blow up their wings as you do a bicycle tire.</p>

<p>(Fabre's book on the sacred beetle also deals, incidentally, with
the Cicada.)</p>

<p>Often one thing is named after another from a merely fanciful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
resemblance, as, for instance, the "sea horse." But the mole
cricket really seems to have been patterned on the mole; either that,
or both the four-legged and the six-legged moles were patterned
after something <i>else</i>. Mole crickets are very useful little people
to know. You should see how they protect their nest-eggs from
the weather and how and why they move their nests up and down
with the change of the seasons.</p>

<p>What good to the soil do the insects do that eat up dead-wood?
Scott Elliott, in his "Romance of Plant Life," deals with this subject.</p>

<p>The mining bees are very interesting, and some of these days,
perhaps millions of years hence, they will be still more interesting,
for they are learning to work together, although not to the extent
that the bees and ants do. Working together seems to develop
the brains of insects just as it does human beings. Thomson's
"Biology of the Seasons" tells how the mining bees are learning
"team-work."</p>

<p>The tarantula spider is a relation of the six-footed farmers, you
should know, although he is not an insect himself. In "Animal
Arts and Crafts" in the "Romance of Science" series you will find
how, in his digging, he makes little pellets of earth, wraps them up
in silk, and then shoots them away, somewhat as a boy shoots a
marble.</p>

<p>The same book tells why the trap-door spider usually builds on
a slope. It also tells why she puts on the front door soon after
beginning her house. (This looks funny, but you wouldn't think
it was so funny if <i>you</i> were a trap-door spider and you had a certain
party for a neighbor, as you will agree when you look it up.)</p>

<p>The door, by the way, has a peculiar edge to make it fit tight.
What kind of an edge would <i>you</i> put on a door to make it fit tight?
(Look at the stopper in the vinegar-cruet and see if it will give
you an idea.)</p>

<p>This book also tells about a certain wasp that makes pottery
and gets her clay from the very same bank that certain other people
depend on for <i>their</i> potter's clay. This wasp sings at her work
and has three different songs for different parts of the work.</p></blockquote>

<h3>FARMERS WITH FOUR FEET</h3>


<p>Before we start this chapter&mdash;it's going to be about
the farmers with four feet, you see&mdash;I want to say something,
and that's this: <i>Don't let anybody tell you moles eat
roots.</i> They don't! They eat the cutworms that do eat
the roots. Haven't I been in mole runs often enough to
know! Of course, the moles do cut a root here and there
occasionally when it happens to be in the way, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
tunnel along, but what does that amount to?</p>

<p>Why, in France they put Mr. Mole in vineyards&mdash;on
purpose! He's one of the regular hands about the place,
just like the hired man.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="I._MR._MOLE_AND_HIS_RELATIONS" id="I._MR._MOLE_AND_HIS_RELATIONS">I. Mr. Mole and His Relations</a></span></h4>

<p>Moles do a lot of good work for the farmer. Not only
were they ploughing and ploughing and ploughing the
soil&mdash;over and over again&mdash;thousands of centuries before
man came along to plant seed in it, but they are all the
time eating, among other things, destructive worms and
insects in the soil. They work all over the world, that is
to say, in the upper half of it&mdash;the Northern Hemisphere;
and there's where the biggest half of the land is, if I haven't
forgotten my geography.</p>


<h5><a name="WONDERFUL_LITTLE_MACHINES_ON_FOUR_LEGS" id="WONDERFUL_LITTLE_MACHINES_ON_FOUR_LEGS"></a>WONDERFUL LITTLE MACHINES ON FOUR LEGS</h5>

<p>Closely related to the moles are the shrews&mdash;quaint
little mouse-like creatures with long, pointed heads and
noses that they can twist about almost any way in hunting
their meals and finding out other things in this big
world that concern them. On these funny, long noses
they have whiskers like a pussy-cat; and that helps, too,
when you want to keep posted on what's going on around
you. Like the moles the shrews are found all over the
Northern Hemisphere. What is known as the "long-tailed
shrew," is the very smallest of our relations among the
mammalia. Why, they're no bigger than the end of a
man's little finger; and the smallest watch <i>I</i> ever heard
of was a good deal bigger than that. Yet, inside these wee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
bodies is as much machinery as it takes to run any other
mammal&mdash;an elephant, say.</p>

<img src="images/i128.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE COMMON AND THE SHORT-TAILED SHREW</p>

</div></div>

<p>The shrews get around very fast, considering their size;
and they're on the go all the time. I never saw such busy-bodies;
nosing about in the old leaves and dead grass and
under logs and boring into loose loam, punky wood, decayed
stumps&mdash;anywhere you'd be likely to find a worm,
a grub, a beetle, or a slug. Hard workers, these shrews,
but <i>so</i> quarrelsome! When two Mr. Shrews meet there's
pretty sure to be trouble. They're regular little swashbucklers
among themselves; and&mdash;the queerest thing,
until you know why&mdash;they don't seem to be afraid even
of cats. Fancy telling Cousin Mouse that! But it isn't
because the shrews <i>wouldn't</i> be afraid if the cats got after
them, but because cats always let shrews alone. They
don't taste good!</p>

<img src="images/i129.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CILIATED SHREW</p>

</div></div>

<p>Shrews are so nimble on their tiny feet and so quick of
hearing, they are very hard to catch. And please don't
try! You simply <i>can't</i> tame them, and in spite of the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
they're so fierce and bold at home&mdash;among their own kind&mdash;they're
easily frightened to death. A shock of fear and
that wonderful little heart engine of theirs stops short&mdash;never
to go again.</p>


<h5><a name="MR_MOLES_PAWS_AND_HOW_HE_WORKS_THEM" id="MR_MOLES_PAWS_AND_HOW_HE_WORKS_THEM">MR. MOLE'S PAWS AND HOW HE WORKS THEM</a></h5>

<p>But while the shrews can get around so much faster
above ground the moles are the most remarkable travellers
<i>under</i> ground. The mole's paws, you notice, are turned
outward, as one's hands are when swimming. In fact he
does almost swim through the soft, loose soil&mdash;so fast
does he move along! His two shovels, with the muscles
that work them, weigh as much as all the rest of his body.
Why, he has a chest like an athlete! He pierces the soil
with his muzzle and then clears it away with his paws.
His skull is shaped like a wedge. He has a strong, boring
snout and a smooth, round body.</p>

<p>This snout, by the way, has a bone near the tip. You
see how handy that would come in, don't you? At the
same time, although it's so hard&mdash;this snout of his&mdash;it's
very sensitive, like the fingers of the blind; for Mr. Mole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
must always be feeling his way along in the dark, you
know.</p>

<p class="caption">SECTION OF MR. MOLE'S CASTLE</p>
<p class="ctext">This is a cross-section of a mole-hill, showing the central chamber and the rooms leading
into it.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The kind of moles you find in Europe live in what seem
to be little earthen fortresses, and the tops, sticking above
ground, make hillocks. In each of these little forts there
is a central chamber; then outside of this, running all the
way around, are two galleries, one above the other. The
upper gallery has several openings into the central chamber.
The galleries are connected by two straight up-and-down
shafts. From the lower galleries several passages,
usually from eight to ten, lead away to where the moles go
out to feed; and if there is a body of water near by&mdash;a pond
or a creek, say&mdash;there's a special tunnel leading to that.</p>

<p>Mr. Mole works hard and he sleeps hard. The big middle
room in his home is the bedchamber of Mr. Mole and
his family. Usually he sleeps soundly all night, but occasionally,
on fine Summer nights, he comes out and enjoys
the air.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>You'd think he'd get awfully dirty, wouldn't you,
boring his way along in the ground all the time? But he
doesn't. His hair is always as spick and span as if he'd
just come out of the barber-shop. Do you know why?
It's because he wears his hair pompadoured. It grows
straight out from the skin. So you see he can go backward
and forward&mdash;as he is obliged to do constantly in
the day's work&mdash;without mussing it up at all. If it lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
down, like yours or like pussy-cat's, it would get into an
<i>awful</i> mess! In France the children call Mr. Mole "The
Little Gentleman in the Velvet Coat."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="II_Four-Footed_Farmers_That_Wear_Armor" id="II_Four-Footed_Farmers_That_Wear_Armor"></a>II. Four-Footed Farmers That Wear Armor</span></h4>

<p>But, speaking of coats, I want to introduce you to a
still more rapid worker in the soil, who wears a coat of mail.
He is called the armadillo. There used to be a species of
armadillo in western Texas. Whether there are any there
still I don't know,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but go on down to South America and
you'll find all you want. The woods are full of them, and
so are those vast prairies&mdash;the pampas. The plates in
the armadillo's coat of mail are not made of steel, of course,
but of bone. These bony plates are each separate from
the other on most of his body but made into solid bucklers
over the shoulders and the hips. The armadillos have
very short, stout legs and very long, strong claws, and
how they can dig! They can dig fast in any kind of soil,
but in the loose soil of the pampas they dig so fast that if
you happen to catch sight of one when out riding and he
sees <i>you</i>, you'll have to start toward him with your horse
on the run if you want to see anything more of him. Before
you can get to him and throw yourself from the saddle,
he'll have buried himself in the ground. And you
can't catch him; not even if you have a spade and dig
away with all your might. He'll dig ahead of you, faster&mdash;a
good deal faster&mdash;than you can follow.</p>

<h5><a name="MR_ARMADILLOS_REMARKABLE_NOSE_DRILL" id="MR_ARMADILLOS_REMARKABLE_NOSE_DRILL">MR. ARMADILLO'S REMARKABLE NOSE DRILL</a></h5>

<p>For all he looks so knightly, so far as his armor is concerned,
the armadillo is timid, peaceful, and never looking
for trouble with anybody, but once aroused fights fiercely
and does much damage with his long hooked claws. His
chief diet is ants. These he finds with his nose. He locates
them by scent and then bores in after them. You'd think
he'd twist it off, that long nose of his; he turns it first one
way and then the other, like a gimlet. And so fast!</p>

<p>The armadillo dislikes snakes as much as all true knights
disliked dragons. That is, he doesn't like them socially;
although he's quite fond of them as a variation in diet.
He'll leap on a snake, paying not the slightest attention to
his attempts to bite through that coat of mail, and tear
him into bits and eat him.</p>

<p>Another armored knight that eats snakes and that other
animals seldom eat&mdash;much as they'd like to&mdash;is the hedgehog.
If you were a fox, instead of a boy or girl, I wouldn't
have to tell you about how hard it is to serve hedgehog
at the family table. One of the earliest things a little fox
learns in countries where there are hedgehogs is to let the
hedgehog alone.</p>

<p>"Hedgehogs would be very nice&mdash;to eat, I mean&mdash;if they
weren't so ugly about not wanting to be eaten."</p>

<p>We can imagine Mamma Fox saying that to the children.
Then she goes on:</p>

<p>"The whole ten inches of a hedgehog&mdash;he's about that
long&mdash;are covered with short, stiff, sharp, gray spines.
He's easy to catch&mdash;just ambles along, hardly lifting his
short legs from the ground. And he goes about at night&mdash;just
when we foxes are out marketing. That would be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
handy, don't you see; but the trouble is about those nasty
spines of his. Try to catch him and he rolls up into a ball
with all his spines&mdash;they're sharp as needles&mdash;sticking out
everywhere, and every which way. And&mdash;well, you simply
can't get at him, that's all. So just don't have anything
to do with him. It's only a waste of time."</p>

<p>Hedgehogs live in hedges and thickets and in narrow
gulches covered with bushes. They do their share of
ploughing when nosing about with their pig-like snouts for
slugs, snails, and insects, and when they dig places for
their home nests. These homes they line with moss,
grass, and leaves, and in them spend the long Winter, indifferent
to the tempests and the cold.</p>

<p>But there's another place to look for hedgehogs, and you
never would guess! In people's kitchens. If you ever go
to England you'll find them in many country homes, helping
with the work. They're great on cockroaches, and
they're perfectly safe from the cat and the dog. Both
Puss and Towser know all about those spines, just as well
as Mrs. Fox does.</p>

<p>When they've eaten all the cockroaches, give them some
cooked vegetables, porridge, or bread and milk, and they'll
be perfectly content. They're easy to tame and get very
friendly.</p>

<p>In the wild state, besides the insects and things I mentioned,
they eat snakes; and poison snakes, too! The
poison never seems to bother them at all. Their table
manners are interesting, also, when it comes to eating
snakes. They always begin at the tail.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> They'd no more
think of eating a snake any other way than one would of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
picking up the wrong fork at a formal dinner.</p>


<h5>UNDER THE HEDGEHOG'S WATER-PROOF ROOF</h5>

<p>That's one of the things about good manners Mamma
Hedgehog teaches the babies, I suppose. Of these she has
from two to four, and she makes a curious nest especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
for them; a nest with a roof on it that sheds rain like any
other roof. Just as it is with puppies and kittens, the
babies are born blind; and not only that, but they can't
hear at first, either. While they are young their spines&mdash;I
don't mean their back-bones, but their other spines&mdash;are
soft, but they become hard as the babies grow and open
their eyes and ears on the world. The muscles on their
backs get very thick and strong, so that when they don't
want to have anything to do with anybody&mdash;say a fox, or
a dog, or a weasel&mdash;they just pull the proper muscle
strings and tie themselves up into a kind of bag made of
their own needle-cushion skins, with the needles all sticking
out, point up!</p>

<h5>TWELVE LITTLE MARMOTS ALL IN ONE BED</h5>

<p>Next I'd like you to visit with me certain other farmers
who remind us of the Middle Ages also; not because they
wear armor, like the armadillos and the hedgehogs and the
lords of castles, but because they live in farm villages as
the farmer peasants used to do around the castles of the
lords. Moreover, one reason they live together in this way
is for protection&mdash;just as it was with the peasants&mdash;only
among these little democrats there's no overlord business;
each one's home is his castle. Another reason for this village
arrangement is that it's such a sociable way to live;
and they're great society people, these farm villagers. The
marmots, for example, the largest and heaviest of the
squirrel family, just love company. In their mountain
country&mdash;they're mountain people, the marmots&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
play together, work together, and during the long, cold
night of Winter snuggle together in their burrows. Their
burrows are close by each other among the rocks. They
have both Summer and Winter residences. In Summer
they go away up in the mountains, hollow out their burrows
and raise their babies. When the snows of late
Autumn send them down the mountainsides, twelve or
fifteen of them, all working together, pitch in and make
a tunnel in the soil among the rocks, enlarging it at the
end into a big room. Next they put in a good pile of dry
hay, carefully close the front door and lock it up with
stones caulked with grass and moss. Then they all cuddle
down together, as snug as you please, and stay there until
Spring.</p>

<p class="caption">HIGHWAYS OF GROUND-SQUIRREL TOWN</p>
<p class="ctext">Almost as crooked as the streets of London town, aren't they? And as hard to find one's
way about in&mdash;unless, of course, one were a ground-squirrel. This is the burrow of a Richardson
ground-squirrel sketched by Thompson Seton, near Whitewater, Manitoba.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Another member of the marmot family who is very fond
of good company is the prairie-dog. There may be thousands
in a prairie-dog town. Each little prairie-dog home
has in front of it a mound something like an Eskimo's hut.
The prairie-dogs make these mounds in digging out their
burrows. They pile the dirt right at the front door. This
may not look neat to us, but you'll see it's just the thing&mdash;this
dirt pile&mdash;when you know what the prairie-dog does
with it. He uses it as a watch-tower.</p>

<p>When, from this watch-tower, he spies certain people he
doesn't want to meet, you ought to see how quickly he can
make for his front door and into the house! The times are
still lawless where the prairie-dog lives, and he has to be
on the lookout all the while for coyotes, for foxes, for
badgers, for the black-footed ferret and the old gray wolf;
to say nothing of hawks and brown owls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<h5><a name="SUCH_NEAT_CHAMBERMAIDS" id="SUCH_NEAT_CHAMBERMAIDS"></a>SUCH NEAT CHAMBERMAIDS!</h5>

<p>The prairie-dogs like sandy or gravelly soil for their
homes, and in making them they do a lot of ploughing.
And besides they supply this same soil with a great deal of
humus&mdash;the grass that they use for bedding. They're very
particular about changing their beds every day; always
clearing out the old bedding and putting in new. They do
this along about sundown. You can see them do it right
in New York City, for there is a flourishing colony of them
at the zoo.</p>

<p class="caption">THIS MUST BE A PLEASANT DAY</p>
<p class="ctext">In nice weather the Prairie Dog's front door stands wide open like this, but before a rain
he stuffs it tight with grass because, when it <i>does</i> rain in the arid regions where he lives, it
comes down in bucketfuls!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Prairie-Dog is about a foot long and as fat as butter.
The reason he's called a dog isn't because he is a dog or
even looks like one, but because he has a sharp little bark
like a very much excited puppy. He thinks he sees something
suspicious: "Yap! Yap!"</p>

<p>Or he spies a neighbor down the street: "Yap! Yap!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Hello, neighbor! Looks like another fine day, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yap! Yap!" says neighbor. (This "yap" passes for
"yes," no doubt&mdash;although it isn't quite the way Mr.
Webster would say it, perhaps.)</p>

<p>Then maybe a neighbor from away over on the avenue,
that he hasn't seen for some time, comes calling&mdash;as they're
always doing, these neighborly little chaps. Then it's:</p>

<p>"Yap! Yap! Yap! Yap! Why, how <i>are</i> you? And
what have you been doing? And how are the little folks?"</p>

<p>And so it goes, all day long.</p>

<p>The prairie-dog's native home is on our Western plains,
but he has a cousin away off in South America&mdash;although
he may never have heard of him&mdash;called the viscacha.</p>

<p>The viscachas live on the great grassy plains of the La
Plata in colonies of twenty or more, in villages of deep-chambered
burrows with large pit-like entrances grouped
close together; so close, in fact, that the whole village makes
one large irregular mound, thirty to forty feet in diameter
and two to three feet high. These villages being on the
level prairie, the viscachas are careful to build them high
enough so that floods will not reach them. They make a
clear space all around the town. In doing this these little
people seem to have two purposes: (1) To make it more
difficult for enemies to slip up on them unnoticed, and
(2) to furnish a kind of athletic field for the community;
for it is in these open spaces that they have their foot-races,
wrestling matches, and the like.</p>

<p>If you ever happen down their way, the first thing that
will strike you is the enormous size of the entrances to the
central burrows. You'd think somebody as big as a bear
lived in them. The entrance is four to six feet across and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
deep enough for a tall man to stand in up to the waist.</p>

<p>Like our prairie-dogs, the viscachas are very sociable,
and little paths, the result of neighborly calls, lead from
one village to another. They are neighborly indeed; and
in the Bible sense. Of course, they like to get together of
an evening and talk things over and gossip and all that,
but that isn't the end of it. To take an instance: These
South American prairie-dogs, like our prairie-dogs up
North, are not popular with the cattlemen; and the cattlemen,
to get rid of them, bury whole villages with earth.
Then neighbors from distant burrows come&mdash;just as soon
as the cattlemen go away&mdash;and dig them out!</p>

<p>Another ploughman besides the prairie-dog and the
viscacha, who isn't popular with farmers&mdash;although
Thompson Seton calls him "The Master Ploughman of
the West"&mdash;is the pocket-gopher. He has farmed it from
Canada to Texas, all through the fertile Mississippi Valley.
The reason he has that queer expression on his face&mdash;you
couldn't help noticing it&mdash;is that each cheek has a big outside
pocket in it; and, like the big pockets in a small boy's
trousers, they're there for business. On each forefoot he
has a set of long claws; and dig, you should see him! He's
a regular little steam-shovel. He sinks his burrow below
the frost-line and into this, stuffed in his two pockets, he
carries food to eat when he wakes up during the following
Spring, before earth's harvests are ripe.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="IV._THE_HOME_OF_THE_RED_FOX" id="IV._THE_HOME_OF_THE_RED_FOX">IV. The Home of the Red Fox</a></span></h4>

<p>Another country gentleman, not as popular with his
neighbors, I must say, as he might be, but whose people,
in the course of the ages, have done a good deal of ploughing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
is Brer Fox. I mean particularly the red fox, for the
gray fox usually lives in hollow trees or in ready-made
houses among the rocks of the mountainside.</p>


<h5>THE THREE ROOMS IN THE FOX HOUSE</h5>

<p>The red fox is the cunningest of his tribe. One of the
ways he shows his cunning&mdash;and also his lack of conscience,
in dealings outside the fox family&mdash;is in his way of getting
a home. Whenever he can find a burrow of a badger, for
example, he drives the badger out and then enlarges the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
place to suit his own needs. For Mr. Fox's residence is
quite an affair. Usually it has three rooms; the front
room where either Mr. or Mrs. Fox&mdash;depending on which
is going marketing&mdash;stops and looks about to see if the
coast is clear; back of that the storeroom for food, and
behind this the family bedroom and nursery.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fox are among
the thriftiest folks I know.
They not only provide for to-day,
but for to-morrow and
the day after. For example,
when Mr. Fox visits a poultry-yard,
he doesn't simply carry
off enough for one meal. He
keeps catching and carrying
off chickens, ducks, or geese&mdash;whatever
comes handy&mdash;all
night; working clear up to
daybreak. And the fresh meat
he thus gets for the family
table he buries&mdash;each fowl in a separate place&mdash;not so very
far away from the poultry-yard. Then later he comes and
gets this buried treasure and takes it home to be shared
with mother and the babies.</p>

<p>Of these babies there are from three to five. Young
foxes are very playful and think there's no such sport as
chasing each other about in the sunshine, while mother
sits in the doorway keeping an eye out for possible danger
and watching their antics with a complacent smile, as much
as to say: "<i>Aren't</i> they the little dears!"</p>

<p>If just one little fox wants to play while his brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and sisters want to sleep&mdash;and that sometimes happens&mdash;he
goes off by himself and chases his own tail around, just
like a kitten.</p>

<p>Little foxes are very nice and polite that way.</p>

<h4>V. <span class="smcap"><a name="Work_and_Play_in_Chipmunkville" id="Work_and_Play_in_Chipmunkville">
Work and Play in Chipmunkville</a></span></h4>

<p>It isn't often one gets a chance to see little foxes at play,
except occasionally in the big city zoos, for foxes are now
so scarce; and, besides, their papas and mammas in the
wild state are suspicious of human spectators, but there
are certain nimble four-legged babies to be found all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the country that play in much the same way.</p>

<p>If, along in July, you should see a certain little body in
a lovely striped suit chasing another little body in a
striped suit, exactly like it, along the old rail fence or
over the boulder wall or across the meadow, ten to one,
it will be two baby chipmunks playing tag. When one
bites the other's tail&mdash;they're always trying to do that in
these tag games&mdash;it means he's "it," I think. In fact, I'm
quite sure, for always, when one little Mr. Chipmunk bites
another little Mr. Chipmunk on the tail, little Mr. Chipmunk
No. 2 turns right around and chases little Mr. Chipmunk
No. 1, and tries to bite <i>his</i> tail.</p>

<p>They keep this up on sunshiny days all through July and
along into early August. Then the serious business of life
begins. They sober down, these chipmunk children&mdash;they
were only born last May&mdash;and learn to make homes for
themselves. You never would think the way they love
the sunshine that the homes of all the chipmunks are under
the ground, and as dark as can be. But they are. You
notice the chipmunks have rather large feet, considering
what dainty little creatures they are. These feet, like the
feet of the mole, are for digging. The chipmunk digs deep
under the roots of trees and stone walls, if there happens
to be either handy by, but, so far as I've seen, he's quite
contented to make his burrows in the open meadows. The
round nest at the end of the burrow is lined with fine grass.
It has two entrances, one right opposite the other, like
front and back doors. Sometimes there are as many as
three doors; four, maybe, in case of a chipmunk of a particularly
nervous disposition. All chipmunks are easily
frightened and dive into their holes, quick as a wink, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
there's any danger; and often when there's really nothing
to be scared at at all.</p>


<h5><a name="WHEN_THOSE_EXTRA_DOORS_COME_HANDY" id="WHEN_THOSE_EXTRA_DOORS_COME_HANDY">WHEN THOSE EXTRA DOORS COME HANDY</a></h5>

<p>But you can't blame them. There are times when it's
no fun being a chipmunk, I tell you. The hawks get after
you, and the minks and the foxes and the weasels. Those
extra doors into the nest are very useful places to dodge
into when you're outside and a savage old hawk swoops
down on you, or a fox makes a jump at you. And they're
just as handy&mdash;these extra doors&mdash;to run <i>out</i> of when a
mink or a weasel follows you in. They'll do that, if you're
a chipmunk; chase you right into your own house!</p>

<p>When a pair of grown-up chipmunks start housekeeping
for themselves&mdash;that is to say when they are about ten
weeks old&mdash;they first dig a little tunnel, almost straight
down for several feet. Then they make a hall that runs
along horizontally&mdash;like anybody's hall&mdash;for a few yards.
Then, supposing you're Mr. or Mrs. Chipmunk in your
new place, after it's all done&mdash;you go up a slant&mdash;a flight
of stairs, you might say, although, of course, there aren't
any stairs&mdash;and there you are in the family bedroom, the
nest.</p>

<p>Not long after the chipmunks stop their outdoor games
in the Fall you might think it was because they had the
mumps; they go around with their faces all swelled out in
such a funny way. The reason is they have their cheeks
full of nuts and seeds that they are storing for the Winter.
They don't put these stores in the nest&mdash;for then where
would they sleep, the nest is so small&mdash;but in special cellars
that they build near the nest, with connecting passages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
These cellars, like the nests, are well below frost-line, so
that Jack can't get the nuts or nip the noses of the chipmunks
while they are asleep.</p>

<p class="caption">PICTURESQUE HOME OF A CONNECTICUT WOODCHUCK</p>
<p class="ctext">This is the truly artistic residence of a Connecticut woodchuck which I found in a rocky
knoll by the wayside during a summer vacation at Kent and reproduced as well as I could
with my fountain-pen. Mr. W. as he often does in digging his burrows, had availed himself
of the protection of the roots of a tree. Here there were two projecting roots, forming a
curious arch over the doorway, which was tastily decorated by a little overhanging vine, on
its way up the knoll, along the stones, and up the foot of the tree.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When Winter finally sets in, the chipmunks get very
drowsy and go up to bed. And there they stay until
Spring&mdash;one great long nap, except that they wake up and
stir around occasionally on bright days and if it happens
to warm up a little.</p>

<p>"Such sleepyheads!" you say. "And what about all those
nuts? I should think they'd be fine for Winter parties."</p>

<p>They would, I dare say. But you know a body doesn't
have much of an appetite when he doesn't get any outdoor
exercise, and that's why the chipmunks only take a few
bites now and then, during the Winter. And, besides, if
they ate up everything in the Winter&mdash;you know how folks
eat at parties&mdash;what would they do in the Spring, with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
good nuts lying around on the ground, as there are in the
Fall; and nothing else to be had that chipmunks care
about? So they keep most of the nuts and seeds and
things for the great Spring breakfast, and all the other
meals, until berries are ripe. The berries they eat until
the next nut harvest comes along.</p>

<p>Until then, you see, they haven't much of anything to
do but play around and sit in the sun and chat. So why
shouldn't they?</p>

"<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23714">Squirrels and Other Fur Bearers</a>"; Comstock's "Pet Book";

<p>Comstock's "Pet Book" also tells about the prairie-dog; and
Seton, in his "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3031">Wild Animals I Have Known</a>," tells about "The
Prairie Dog and His Kin."</p>

<p>It's a very common superstition among English country folk that
shrews always drop dead if they attempt to cross a road. How do
you suppose such a strange idea ever got started? Allen, in his
"Nature's Work Shop," reasons it out, and his reasons seem very
plausible. It's a fact that their dead bodies are nearly always
found in roadways. You'll also find some interesting information
about shrews in Johonnott's "Curious Flyers, Creepers and Swimmers"
and Wright's "Four-Footed Americans."</p>

<p>There's some little dispute about squirrels as tree-planters; that
is to say as to just how they do it, for there's no question that they
<i>do</i> plant oaks and other trees. Thoreau, in his "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/205">Walden</a>," gives the
squirrel credit for doing an immense amount of tree-planting, but
Ernest Ingersoll, in his article on squirrels in "Wild Neighbors,"
thinks the squirrel leaves comparatively few acorns or hickory-nuts,
and that he doesn't forget where he puts them, as other writers
on nature say. "They seem to know precisely the spot," says Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Ingersoll, "where each nut is buried, and go directly to it; and I
have seen them hundreds of times when the snow was more than a
foot deep, wade floundering through it straight to a certain point,
dive down, perhaps far out of sight, and in a moment emerge with
a nut in their jaws."</p>

<p>But <i>how</i> the squirrel knows it's there&mdash;that's the mystery! Read
what Ingersoll says about it. The whole essay is extremely good
reading, and will tell you a number of things to watch out for in
squirrels that you perhaps never have noticed.</p>

<p>In Pliny's "Natural History" you will find, among other quaint
stories, one to the effect that mountain marmots put away hay in
the fall by one animal using itself as a hay-rack&mdash;lying on his back
with his load clasped close while he is pulled home by the tail.
"Animal Arts and Crafts" tells what a simple little thing originated
this idea. Many of the peasants of the Alps still believe it.</p>

<p>Hornaday, in his "Two Years in the Jungle," gives an interesting
account of how one of the four-footed knights in armor&mdash;the
pangolin&mdash;does himself up in a ball, and how next to impossible
it is to "unlock" him.</p>

<p>Ingersoll, in discussing the various uses of tails in "Wild Neighbors,"
tells how a gerboa kangaroo brings home grass for his nest,
done up in a sheaf of which his own little tail is the binder.</p>

<p>An interesting four-footed burrower, when he can't rob a prairie-dog
of his hole&mdash;or some other body smaller than himself&mdash;is the
coyote. There is a long talk on the coyote and his ways in "Wild
Neighbors." This little book also gives pictures of the different
kinds of shrews in the United States, and a lot of detail about them
and their little paws and their noses and their tails.</p>

<p>It's a queer thing how systematic and prompt shrews and moles

<h3>WATER FARMERS WHO HELP MAKE LAND</h3>


<p>As we all spend more or less time in the water in August
I thought it would be a good idea to take as the subject
of this chapter the lives of the water farmers. Some of
these&mdash;the crayfish and the turtle, for example&mdash;you know
well, and everybody has heard of the beaver family, but
they will all bear closer acquaintance. I know, for I've
spent a good deal of time among them.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="I_The_Turtle_People" id="I_The_Turtle_People"></a>I. The Turtle People</span></h4>

<p>Every boy who has tramped along creeks and ponds
knows the mud-turtle. We ought to call him a tortoise,
perhaps, but the name turtle is more common. I don't
know why; perhaps because it's a little easier to say.
Strictly speaking, the name "turtle" is applied to the
members of the family that have flippers, and spend nearly
all their time in the water; while the tortoises are the ones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
that have feet and put in much of their time on land.
(And then, of course, there are the tortoises of fables that
run races with hares, and so teach us not to be too confident
of ourselves because we think we are cleverer than
some other people.)</p>

<p class="caption">A HAWKSBILL TURTLE</p>

</div></div>

<p>The common box-turtle of the United States you'll meet
in the woods in the evening and early morning, wandering
about looking for something to eat. He spends practically
all his time on land in Summer; and in the Winter, all his
time in bed. As soon as cold weather comes on he digs a
hole in the ground, or scoops out a place under some
brush, and turns in.</p>

<p>But the box-turtle&mdash;he's really a tortoise&mdash;is what some
of his relatives would call a "landlubber," no doubt, for
many of the tortoises who live in the sea rarely leave it;
as if they had half a mind to go back and be only flipper
people, as the ancestors of both the turtles and the tortoises
must have been; since all life is supposed to have
begun in the sea.</p>

<p>All the tortoises of temperate regions dig in for the
Winter, but one Southern member of the family makes his
home in a dugout throughout the year. He's called the
"gopher" turtle. The gopher turtles are natives of
Florida, and live in pairs in burrows. Other members
of the turtle tribe do not pair, but there's one time in
their lives when both land and water turtles dig into the
soil and that's when they are laying their eggs. The
females scoop out hollows with their hind legs, kicking up
the dirt, first with one leg and then with the other. But
they're as careful of the dirt they dig out as a beaver is
when he digs a canal. They scrape it up in a little ridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
all around the hole.</p>

<p>What for? Just watch.</p>


<h5>HOW MOTHER TURTLE "TAMPS" HER NEST</h5>

<p>As soon as she has finished laying her eggs, Mother Turtle
carefully scrapes this dirt back over them and tamps
it down, much as a foundryman tamps the sand in a mould.
You can guess what she uses for a tamper&mdash;the under side
of her shell, raising and lowering herself on her legs like a
Boy Scout taking his morning setting-up exercises in a
Summer camp. After that she doesn't pay any more attention
to her eggs. She leaves the sun to do her hatching
for her. Both land and sea turtles&mdash;or, more properly
speaking, the tortoises and the turtles&mdash;hatch their young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
in this way. The sea-turtles scramble up out of the water
on their flippers, much as a seal does in climbing on a
rock, and make their way back from the shore, great
crowds of them, at nesting-time, to some stretch of sand,
and there lay their eggs. This march of the mother turtles
always takes place at night. When the young are
hatched they dig their way up through the sand and make
for the sea.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="II._THE_CRAB_FAMILY" id="II._THE_CRAB_FAMILY">II. The Crab Family</a></span></h4>

<p>Another one of the water people who help make land
and one that everybody knows, is the crayfish. Every
small boy is afraid Mr. Crayfish will catch his little big
toe sooner or later, when he goes swimming; although I
never heard of a crayfish that did. But they never worry
about <i>their</i> toes&mdash;the crayfish don't. When they lose a
whole foot even&mdash;as they often do&mdash;it grows right out
again. The science people say this is because they belong
to a low order in the animal world, but I think it would
come in right handy for any of us&mdash;this way of regrowing
not toe-nails alone, but toes and all&mdash;don't you?</p>

<p>The crayfish, as you may know, love to burrow in the
mud, for you are always coming across their little mud
towers along the margins of the brooks. Related to the
crayfish are the crabs. Mother Nature seems to have
been very fond of crabs&mdash;she has made them after so many
different patterns and scattered them all over the world;
in the deep sea, along the shallows of its shores, and on
land. Those you are most apt to meet must have more or
less business on land, for the shape of their legs shows that
they are formed for walking rather than swimming. But go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
far out to sea and you'll find crabs with paddles on all four
pairs of legs, like banks of oars; while others, living on the
borders of the sea, have paddles only on the last pair.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei153" name="imagei153"></a><div class="figborder">

<p class="caption">SOUTH SEA ISLAND AND COCOANUT COLUMBUS</p>
<p class="ctext">Here we are on an island of the Southern Seas&mdash;the home of a colony of cocoanut crabs.
One of the members of the colony is climbing a tree to get a nut. "And who has a better
right?" says he. "This tree," he might continue, "is the descendant of a nut that some of
my ancestors sailed upon to this island; for a cocoanut, dropping into the water from a tree
near some far shore, often carries on it the crab who had started to eat it. Then a current
of the sea carries the nut and its passenger to some other island. Later cocoanut Santa
Marias and their Columbuses reach the island in the same way, and so it becomes populated
with both cocoanuts and crabs&mdash;which makes it very nice for the crabs!"</p>
</div></div>

<p>One of the big families of crabs live on land most of the
time and make burrows in which they live. These have
legs specially fitted for digging. Like most of the crab
family, the land-crab earns its living at night and, except
in rainy weather, seldom leaves its burrow by day. Like
small boys, these crabs seem to love to play in the rain.
The fact is they do this to keep their gills wet; for, although
they spend most of their time on land, crabs breathe with
their gills, like fish; and while some of them&mdash;as the mountain
crab of the West Indies&mdash;live quite a distance back
from the sea, they must have some moisture for their
gills, and this they get, in part, in their damp cellars&mdash;the
burrows.</p>

<p>But it's queer, isn't it, what different ways people have
of looking at things? Take land crabs and turtles, for
example. Turtles, when they lay their eggs, think the only
thing is to get clear away from the water and put their
eggs in an incubator, as we saw them do a few pages back.
The land-crabs evidently think just the opposite; for no
matter how far they may live away from the sea&mdash;one,
two, even three miles sometimes&mdash;nothing will do but they
must go to the water to lay their eggs. In April and May
you'll see them swarming down by hundreds and thousands.
And they'll climb right over you if you don't get
out of their way!</p>

<p>"This is my busy day and I can't stop for anything,"
says Mrs. Crab.</p>

<p>Besides the work they do for the soil in grinding and
mixing it, the crab people, like all the crustaceans, help a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
lot by adding lime to it, and that's one of the very best
things you can do to soil, you know. They add this lime
when they change their clothes; that is, when they moult
or cast their shells. The shell they take off as if it were
indeed a dress. They "unbutton" it down the back.
Sometimes, in trying to get out of the legs of the suit, they
leave not only the leg covering but the leg itself. That
leg is good for the soil, too, of course, and the loss of a leg
doesn't bother a crab so very much. He just grows a new
one, that's all!</p>

<p>These shells&mdash;particularly the shells of the largest species
of crabs&mdash;not only contain a great deal of lime but carbon
and phosphorus, also, and these are splendid soil stuff,
too. In the smaller kinds of crabs&mdash;of crustaceans, generally&mdash;these
shells are mostly chitin, the stuff that the
coverings of insects is made of.</p>

<p>The crustaceans, by the way, are closely related to the
insects. You may <i>suspect</i> this by comparing their shapes,
but then you'll see there isn't any doubt about it when
I tell you that in getting born from the egg, the crabs and
their kin don't come out dressed in their final shape, but
change after they are born, first into one shape and then
into another, just as insects do. Each shape, as it comes
along, looks funnier than the rest; that is, it looks funny
to us, but not, naturally, to the crabs. It must seem just
the thing to them, for they always dress the same way and
look as solemn about it as a man does when he wears a
monocle. In fact, they do something almost as funny as
wearing a monocle. For many of them carry their eyes
about, not on the end of a cord, to be sure, but on the end
of a stick. These "sticks" are called foot stalks. And
they're not a bad idea either&mdash;for a crab. By moving them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
around the crabs can keep much better posted on what is
going on about them than they could otherwise; particularly
as a crab always moves sidewise or backward. What
good a monocle does, though, nobody knows.</p>

<p>But if we can hardly look a crab in the eye and keep a
straight face, what would we do if we met a duck-billed
mole? We'd laugh right out! I'm sure of it, for that's
what even the men of science did when they saw the first
one that came to England. This strange foreigner&mdash;it
came to London all the way from Australia&mdash;had a body
like a mole. But you couldn't call it a mole. For one thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
it had a bill like a duck. Yet no more could you call it a
duck; for, besides having a body like a mole, it had a tail
like a beaver. Still I'm afraid the beavers wouldn't have
owned it&mdash;hospitable as they are&mdash;even if they could have
overlooked that bill. For&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;this duck-billed,
mole-bodied, beaver-tailed creature lays eggs!</p>

<p class="caption">THE ANIMAL X FROM THE ANTIPODES</p>
<p class="ctext">A mole's body, a duck's bill, a beaver's tail, this strange citizen of that land of strange
animals, Australia, lays eggs like a bird and suckles its young like a pussy-cat! Do you
wonder that the wise men of London laughed at the idea that there is any such creature&mdash;even
when they were looking right at one?</p>
</div></div>

<p>Yet the ducks just couldn't take it into their families
either, for what else do you think it does? It suckles its
young, like a pussy-cat! Talk about your sensations; it
made the hit of the season&mdash;this Animal X from the Antipodes.
The learned men of London town, they looked
him up and they looked him down, and they came to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
same conclusion, at first, that the old gentleman did when
he saw the dromedary. They said: "They <i>ain't</i> no such
animal!" (Only, of course, being learned men, they used
good grammar.)</p>

<p>They really did say that in effect, and you can't blame
them; for, as if to complete the joke, the first member of
the duck-billed mole family to move in scientific society
came in like a Christmas turkey; in other words, he was a
stuffed specimen. So the men of science said he wasn't
<i>real</i> at all; that he was just made up of the parts of <i>other</i>
animals. But being true men of science, after all, they
finally began looking up the stranger's record among his
neighbors back in Australia, and they found there actually
are living creatures in that land of strange creatures, just
like that specimen, and that they live in burrows which
they dig in the banks of the streams.</p>

friend and is also a native of Australia. It uses that long, tapering nose and those claws to
burrow for the ants on which it lives.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Still the scientists didn't know what to call this paradox
of the animal kingdom; so they named him just that&mdash;paradoxicus,
<i>Ornythoryncus paradoxicus</i>. A little Greek
boy, without having to look it up in a dictionary, would
have told us that "ornythoryncus" means "bird-billed";
for it's like those Greek picture words that always told
their own story to the little Greeks. As for "paradox"
if you don't know what that means, look it up in the dictionary
and then look at the <i>Ornythoryncus paradoxicus</i>,
and you'll understand.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="IV._THE_BEAVERS" id="IV._THE_BEAVERS">IV. The Beavers</a></span></h4>

<p>Of course you wouldn't like to be a duck-billed mole&mdash;nobody
would, but I always thought it would be rather
nice to be a beaver. The beaver is, in many ways, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
most remarkable of all the water people that help make
the lands that give us bread.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei159" name="imagei159"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i159.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BEAVERS AT WORK AND AT PLAY</p>
<p class="ctext">Whether he's working because he is more industrious than those beavers in
the water or because it's recess time with them, the young
beaver gnawing the tree seems to be having quite as good a time
practising his profession as the others do in playing about.</p>
</div></div>

<p>But it is not alone for the amount of work he does that
I admire Mr. Beaver so much; it is for his intelligent, not
to say brilliant, way of doing it. Suppose, for instance,
you had to build a house out in the water, the way our
great, great-grandparents, the lake-dwellers, did, to protect
yourself from enemies and for other reasons. And then suppose
you didn't have any <i>tools</i>; nothing but a pair of
paws and a set of teeth. Could you do it?</p>

<p>Another thing: The lake-dwellers had plenty of water
to build in; plenty, but not too much. The beavers don't
have this advantage. They usually build in the water of
flowing streams, and they have to make their <i>own</i> lakes.
How would you do it; even if you had tools? But remember,
being a beaver, you've got nothing to use but
two honest paws and a set of teeth. It was with these Mr.
Beaver did it all&mdash;with his teeth, his paws, and his head;
the inside of his head, I mean&mdash;his brain. Take the matter
of water arrangements. He gets the water to lie quietly
and at just the right depth by building his dam across the
stream. This dam not only provides him with water of
just the right depth to protect his front door from enemies
and to keep rushing torrents from carrying his house away,
but the spreading out of the original stream bed into a
pond helps in gathering the Fall harvest of trees, since it
brings the trees nearer to the water's edge, and water
transportation among beavers, as among men, is always
cheapest.</p>

<p>Although dams are usually built of trees which the
beavers cut down themselves, they also use cobblestones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
where trees are scarce; for Mr. Beaver is a very thrifty
soul; he doesn't waste material nor time nor effort. Many
books about beavers say they cut the trees so they will
fall across the stream, but Mills says, in his book on the
beaver, written after many years of patient observation,
that beavers don't seem to care how the tree falls, just so
it doesn't fall on <i>them</i>! Not but what they <i>could</i> cut trees
to fall in the water if they thought best; for just watch
them build a dam and see how clever they are; cleverer,
possibly, than some of us.</p>

<img src="images/i161.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BEAVERS AT WORK ON A DAM</p>
<p class="ctext">See how many of the features of the building of a beaver dam, as described in our story
of these wise little people, you can make out in this picture.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Let's see. Say you've got your trees up to where the
dam is to be; now how are you going to set them in building
the dam?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<h5>SEE IF YOU'RE AS CLEVER AS MR. BEAVER</h5>

<p>"Right across the dam," you would say, wouldn't you?
That is what most people have said when I have asked
them that question; for that is the way men do it. But
remember, if you built the dam as men build dams you
would have to drive stakes or do something to keep the
logs from washing away. Years ago, when writers used
to theorize a great deal on how things were done, instead
of getting outdoors and watching patiently to see how they
actually <i>were</i> done, it was said that Mr. Beaver in building
his dam did really drive stakes and that he did it with
that big tail of his. But what Mr. Mills found was that
the beaver lays his trees lengthwise of the stream. You
see why that is, don't you? When the trees are laid lengthwise,
the water, instead of striking them broadside, strikes
only the end and so there is less likelihood of their being
carried away.</p>

<p>Another thing, two things, about the trees in the dam&mdash;in
fact four:</p>

<p>1. It wouldn't do, you see, to lay the trees broadside
to the stream, but what position could we give them that
would help still further in keeping the water from carrying
them away?</p>

<p>2. Shall we use trees with the branches still on them or
trees trimmed down like sticks of cord-wood? (What
kind do you see in the picture of the beaver dam?)</p>

<p>3. Or shall we use both trimmed and untrimmed trees?
If so, why? And how?</p>

<p>4. If we use untrimmed trees, which end shall we put
up-stream? The butt or the tip?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei163" name="imagei163"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i163.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SECTION OF A BEAVER DAM</p>
<p class="ctext">You can see that there was a sufficient flow of water in the stream from which this sketch
of a section of a beaver dam was taken; otherwise the dam would have been plastered with
mud to conserve the supply. The longest slope, of course, was up-stream&mdash;a fundamental
principle in beaver bridge engineering.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In building his dam the beaver uses, for the most part,
slender green poles trimmed and cut in lengths; but mixed
with these are small untrimmed trees which he places with
the butt end up-stream, and propped with mud and sticks
so that the up end will be a foot or so higher than the down
end. In this way, you see, the branches are made to resist
the push of the waters against the butt end; while, if they
were placed the other way, the current would have a pulling
purchase on the butt end. The raising of the ends also
lessens the pushing force of the water as it doesn't strike
the butt of the tree "full on," as it would otherwise do.
And the branches not only help to hold the trees in place,
but, together, form a kind of foundation on which to pile
and intermix the trimmed poles.</p>

<p>The timbers, being cut green, become water-soaked.
This makes them heavier and so causes them to sink and
helps to hold them in place; while the branches and twigs
of the untrimmed trees form a kind of basketwork that
catches the sediment and drift of the stream, and so the
dam lets less and less water through. The upside stream
is plastered by the beavers with mud in cases where the
flow of water in the stream is meagre. Otherwise it is left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
unplastered. You see Mr. Beaver's idea is not to make
the dam absolutely water-tight, for then it would be running
over all the time and so be worn away. What he
wants is a dam that will let the water through slowly and
at the same time keep a proper level.</p>

<p class="ctext">Here is a beaver home as it looks before the time lock is put on in the Fall.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Beaver's chief purpose in building these dams seems
to be to keep his front-door yard full of water. This may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
look like a funny idea at first, but in this, as in other things,
Mr. Beaver shows he has a very wise head on his shoulders;
for one peculiarity of his life is that he is obliged to
come and go through the cellar door. As he doesn't want
any of his enemies&mdash;the wolf, the coyote, and all that class
of people&mdash;to use this door, he keeps it under water. And
in winter-time, when he goes out to the wood-pile to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
something to eat, the water must be deep enough so that
the pond doesn't freeze solid to the bottom.</p>

<p class="caption">A BEAVER HOME WITH TIME LOCK</p>
<p class="ctext">Here, as it looks after being made secure against hungry wolves and the Winter winds.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As for those professional highwaymen, the wolves and
coyotes, that are so much bigger than he is, Mr. Beaver
keeps out of their way in Summer, when they don't bother
much about him, anyway, as he sticks so close to the water
and is hard to catch. In the Winter, when they get hungry
and desperate and would break into his house, if they could,
he makes it practically burglar-proof, by putting on a time
lock; a lock that just won't open, even to a wolf's sharp
claws, until Spring.</p>

<p>And in the simplest way.</p>

<p>Just before Winter sets in Mr. Beaver plasters the outside
of his house with mud, and the mud freezes as hard
as a stone. But sometimes, even among the beavers, there
are shiftless characters, like that Arkansas man who just
<i>wouldn't</i> look after his roof. These careless beavers don't
plaster their roofs. But then, just see what happens! Some
hungry wolf comes along and breaks through and has a
nice fat beaver for supper, maybe. And maybe not; for,
even in that case, if Mr. Beaver wakes up in time, he dives
down through the cellar door and into the tunnel and out
under the ice.</p>

<p>"Aha! You got fooled that time, didn't you? You
mean old thing!" (Can't you almost hear him say it?)</p>

<p>In putting the mud coating on their houses or dams
the beavers carry it in their fore paws. Sometimes, in a
very steep place, they climb up the roof with three feet
and hold the mud with one. When they have delivered
the mud they use these same little paws to pat it down&mdash;not
their trowel-like tails, as one would naturally suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<h5>THAT MYSTERY ABOUT THE BEAVER'S TAIL</h5>

<p>Then what <i>do</i> they do with those tails? Well, for one
thing, they sometimes use them to carry mud by curling
them between their legs and holding the mud against their
bodies. Perhaps they resort to this way of carrying mud
where they have such a steep climb up the roof they need
all four legs to climb with; or it may be just an individual
fancy of some beavers. For, being really <i>thinkers</i> and not
mere machines, acting entirely on what is called instinct,
different beavers have different ways of doing things. The
beaver's tail is also very useful in swimming, and Mr.
Beaver is a great swimmer. You should see him. He
swims mostly with his hind feet and tail, holding his fore
paws against his breast as a squirrel does when he's sitting
up looking at you. His tail he uses as one uses an oar in
sculling, turning it slightly on edge as he works it back
and forth.</p>

<p>But he has two other important uses for this big tail,
as we shall now see; for the beavers of this colony we are
watching, having put up their dam and built their big
house, are now ready for the Fall harvest that is to provide
for the long Winter. The beavers are strict vegetarians.
Their diet consists of the tender bark of young
trees and roots dug from the bottom and along the banks
of the ponds in which they live.</p>

<p>"But, for mercy's sake, where are they going to get the
tender bark of trees in the dead of Winter, when all the
trees are frozen solid and the beavers can't get from under
the ice anyhow?"</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Beaver has thought out just how to do it and
we didn't. That's the beauty of being a beaver. What
he does is to cut down small trees, trim them, divide them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
into lengths, and then heap them up in a great pile at his
door, under the water.</p>

<p>By the time they are three years old beavers feel grown-up;
as, indeed, they are in size, although, like certain other
young people I could name, they have a great deal yet to
learn. At this age they choose their mates and either settle
down in the home colony or go away somewhere else.</p>

<p>School takes up with the beavers in September. All
through September and October the harvest is gathered
and preparations made for the long Winter. The baby
beavers of the Spring, who by this time are four or five
months old, take part in the harvesting; at least they
play at it. They don't do much, but they learn a great
deal. Now let's all be little beavers for a few minutes and
see what we can learn. We are out in the harvest-field&mdash;the
woods&mdash;with father, and he's going to cut down a tree
for the Winter food-pile. Watch him.</p>

<p>He picks out a young tree something less than six inches
thick. Then he looks up as if he wanted to see what kind
of a day it was going to be; although the fact is he never
bothers his head about the weather. What he is really
looking up for is to see if the top of the tree he is going to
chop down is likely to get tangled in the tops of other trees
when it falls. (All beavers, I should add, don't take this
precaution; only the older and wiser ones.) After this
inspection he either cuts the tree in two with his long sharp
chisel teeth so that it will fall clear of the tangling branches
of other trees, or, if he sees he can't prevent this, he moves
away to another tree.</p>

<p>Just before the tree is ready to fall he thumps the ground
several times with his tail to warn other beavers working
near by. They all scamper as fast as their fat bodies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
short legs will let them. If they are near water, as they
usually are&mdash;they "plunk" into it. After the tree falls
the limbs are cut off, the trunk gnawed into sections four
to six feet long, depending on the size of the trunk, the
distance from the water, and the number of beavers that
are going to help move it. Although, as a rule, only one
beaver works on a tree in cutting it down, they all pitch
in and help in getting the sections home; dragging them
across the ground and into the pond or into one of their
wonderful canals.</p>


<h5>THE BEAVERS AND THEIR PANAMA CANALS</h5>

<p>The beavers knew all about digging canals long before
the days of Colonel Goethals. They dug them for much
the same reason we dug the great Panama Canal, to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
time and expense in moving freight and for protection
from possible enemies. On land the beaver is easy prey
for wolves and such, but once in the water he can laugh
at them. These canals not only enable him to haul his
wood easily and safely, but are just the things to dive into
when somebody is after you. Another purpose of the
canals is to fill ponds where water is getting low; or to
make a pond where there isn't any at all, as in a dry ravine.</p>

<p>Whether you look at them from the standpoint of their
intelligence and good habits, or their usefulness, beavers
are the most interesting of all our little four-legged brothers
of field or wood, and it is pleasing to know that many
States have passed laws to protect them.</p>

<p class="caption">SUN BATH AFTER THE SWIM</p>
<p class="ctext">Boys, after an hour or so in the "ole swimmin' hole," like to take a sun bath. That's
what these young beavers are doing on a nice grassy spot by the pond.</p>
</div></div>

<p>And besides he is such a good fellow, Mr. Beaver is;
peaceable, industrious, dependable, and with the best
heart in the world! Why, do you know what they do&mdash;the
beavers&mdash;when neighbors get burned out by forest-fires
or their houses broken into by a mean old wolf or
coyote or anything? Take them right in, children and all!</p>

<p>If you were a little beaver you'd have from two to four
twin brothers and sisters to start with, and then two to
four more for each of the remaining two years before you
left home to make your own way in the world. You'd
be born with your eyes open and not like a puppy or kitten.
And, what do you think, <i>in less than two weeks</i> you could
go swimming. Mother would be right with you in case
anything happened. Then when you were tired swimming
you'd climb up on top of the house and rest and doze
in the sun; take your afternoon nap just like any other
baby.</p>

<p>But maybe it wouldn't be your own mamma that would
be with you; for lots of sad things happen to beaver people,
and when one little beaver's mother dies another mother
beaver will take care of him, and all his brothers and sisters
besides! Mr. Mills tells in that most interesting book of
his about how one day a mother beaver was killed by a
hunter who thought he didn't have anything better to do
than kill poor little beavers; and the very next evening a
lady beaver, who <i>already</i> had four babies of her own,
travelled a quarter of a mile with them to the house of
her dead neighbor and stayed there and brought all the
little orphans up!</p>

<blockquote><p>The crayfish is a thing you've got to take seriously if you want
to get the most out of it. Huxley says that a thorough study of a
crayfish is almost a whole course in zoology. Think of going to
school to a crayfish! But you'd enjoy it, I'm sure. For just look&mdash;and
these are only a few of the interesting things you will find
in Huxley's famous book on "The Crayfish":</p>

<p>How they swim backward (no doubt you know this already),
and how they walk on the bottom of the water.</p>

<p>Why they seem to know the points of the compass&mdash;for they
prefer rivers that run north and south.</p>

<p>Why they are most active toward evening.</p>

<p>Where they spend the winter.</p>

<p>Why they eat their old clothes.</p>

<p>How early in the spring you may expect to find them.</p>

<p>When they hatch their eggs and how the mother crayfish uses
her tail for a nursery.</p>

<p>In what respect they resemble moths.</p>

<p>How they chew their meals with their feet and work their jaws

<p>How they grow by fits and starts, and what this has to do with
the way they change their clothes.</p>

<p>How you can tell the age of a crayfish. (You don't do it by
looking at its teeth. You couldn't see its teeth anyway, because
they are in its stomach.)</p>

<p>And all this in less than the first fifty pages of a book, which has
more than 350.</p>

<p>One of the most famous of the crab family, not only on account
of his part in agriculture, but because of his funny ways, is the
robber-crab. You should read about the wild life of adventure
some of these crabs lead&mdash;regular Robinson Crusoes who get
wrecked on islands far away from home and build houses there and
shift for themselves in many ingenious ways, just as the human
Robinson Crusoe did. Kingsley's "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1697">Madam How and Lady Why</a>"
has some interesting pages about them; and so has Darwin's "Voyage
Around the World."</p>

<p>Of the many things that have been written about beavers the
following are among the most interesting: The story of the beaver
in "Stories of Adventure," edited by Edward Everett Hale; "The
Forest Engineer," by T. W. Higginson, in Johonnott's "Glimpses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the Animal World"; "How the Beaver Builds His House," in "The
Animal Story Book," edited by Lang; "The Builders," in Lang's
"Ways of Wood Folks"; and "The House in the Water," by Roberts.</p>

<p>The most interesting book of all on beavers, however, is "The
Beaver World," by Mills, referred to in this chapter. I have not
told you one-half of the remarkable things you will find about
them in this book.</p>

<p>One of the most curious is about how a beaver sometimes gets
his breath in the winter time. He may have to travel quite a distance
under the ice, and one good breath has to last him to the end
of the journey.</p>

<p>"But does he hold his breath all this time? How can he?"</p>

<p>He can't. He just uses the same breath over again. See how
he does it. The Mills book tells.</p>

<p>Look up the muskrat and compare his ways with those of the
beaver.</p>

<p>In the "Country Life Reader" you will find a graphic description
of one of the perils of life for the beavers and their cousins the
muskrats; namely in attacks by the great horned owl.</p></blockquote>

<h3>FARMERS WHO WEAR FEATHERS</h3>


<p>Sh! Go easy! Pretend you're a horse or a cow.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> We've
gone south with the swallows&mdash;it's September you see&mdash;and
those queer birds over there are flamingoes. The flamingoes
are a shy lot; I don't know why. I can't think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
it's on account of their looks; for there's the kiwi, the hornbill,
and sakes alive&mdash;the puffins! <i>They</i> all have funny
noses, too, but none of them are particularly shy, and you
can walk right up to a Papa Puffin almost. Whatever the
reason is, the flamingoes are very easily frightened and
they're particularly suspicious of human beings. Yet
we've simply got to meet them and have them in this chapter,
for they are among the most interesting of the feathered
workers of the soil. They just live in mud; build those
tower-like nests out of it, walk about in it, and get their
meals by scooping up mud and muddy water from the
marshes where they live, on the borders of lakes and seas.
They strain out the little creatures wiggling about in these
scooped-up mouthfuls.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">I. Feathered Farmers with Queer Noses</span></h4>

<p>"What a funny nose! What happened to it?"</p>

<p>I knew you'd say that. Everybody does. But just
watch now and see. That flamingo over there, stalking
about on his stilt-like legs, sticks his long neck down to the
muddy water, turns that funny nose upside down and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, of all things, is he going to stand on his head?"</p>


<h5>WHY FLAMINGOES HAVE SUCH FUNNY NOSES</h5>

<p>No, not that. Don't you see, he's getting his dinner?
After that crooked scoop bill&mdash;for that's what it really is,
a scoop&mdash;is filled, the water strains out through ridges
along the edge of the bill and what's left is his food.</p>

<p>That picture looks as if it had a tremendous lot of flamingoes
in it, doesn't it? It has. It's quite a town, Flamingoburg
is. Although flamingoes are so wary about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
meeting two-legged people without feathers&mdash;that is, human
beings&mdash;they're very sociable among themselves and
there may be a thousand, even two thousand, pair in a
single flamingo city, such as Doctor Chapman studied in
the Bahama Islands some years ago.</p>

<p>Their nests are cupped-out hollows in little towers of
dried mud raised a foot or so to keep high tides from
swamping them. They scrape up the mud with that
shovel-like bill. After the conical-tower nest is made, the
mud piled up and patted into shape with her bill and feet,
Mother Flamingo lays one or two eggs&mdash;and then she goes
to setting. You notice there's just one little chick in the
nest in the lower left-hand corner of the picture, and just
one egg in the nest near by.</p>

<p>With such a low stool to sit on you wonder what the
mother bird does with her long legs. In some pictures in
children's nature books of not so many years ago you'll
find her represented as sitting on the nest with her legs
hanging down the sides&mdash;but you see that couldn't be;
the nest isn't tall enough. What she really does is to fold
her legs under her body; just once, of course, at the joint.
But they're so long that, even when folded, they reach
out beyond her tail. While setting, the lady birds reach
around with their long necks shovelling up things to eat
and gossiping, more or less, with the neighbors; for the
nests, you notice, are very close together. Sometimes two
of them will reach across the narrow alley that separates
the residence of Mrs. Flamingo Smith from Mrs. Flamingo
Jones, take each other playfully by the bill and
hold together for a while. Maybe this is their way of saying
"Good morning," or "How do you do?"</p>

</div>



<p>You'd hardly think it&mdash;with those long legs of theirs&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the flamingoes swim beautifully. With their long necks
drawn back&mdash;the way swans do it, you know&mdash;they are
very graceful, and a flock of them floating about is one
of the loveliest sights in the world. They look like a big,
fleecy, pink cloud resting right on the surface of the water.
You can now find only a few flamingoes in Florida, where
there used to be so many; but go on south into Central
and South America and there are thousands of them. They
are still fairly numerous in countries bordering the Mediterranean
and the Indian Ocean. In Persia they are called
"red geese." And the name isn't so far wrong as you'd
think. You notice that, unlike those stilt-walkers, the
herons, the flamingoes have webbed feet. Like geese and
ducks, also, they have those rows of tooth-like ridges on
the edges of their bills. It is these "teeth" that, coming
together, act as strainers.</p>

<p>But a queer thing about their bills, besides the funny-way
they have of crooking down all of a sudden, is that
the upper bill is smaller and fits down into the lower.
Stranger still, the birds can raise and lower this upper bill
like the cover of a coffee-pot.</p>

<p>They can move the under bill a little, too, but not to
amount to anything; so you see there was even more to
the upside-downness of that bill than there seemed to be
at first. The whole arrangement looks odd to us, but it
works out beautifully for the birds. When they turn their
heads upside down they can stir the ooze to various depths,
as required, by using the upper bill as a ploughshare and
setting it at different angles.</p>

<p>Although they've borrowed some ideas from both the
goose and the heron families, the flamingoes are so different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
from either they are put into a family by themselves, the
<i>Ph&oelig;nicopteridæ</i>. This family name is from two Greek
words meaning "red-winged." If you want to be formal
in speaking of or to a goose you must refer to her family
as the <i>Anserinæ</i> which is Latin for "geese."</p>

<p class="caption">WHERE THE FLAMINGO KEEPS ITS TEETH</p>
<p class="ctext">While teeth, like those of the Hesperornis, went out of fashion ages ago, the flamingoes
have substitutes for teeth which answer their purposes much better. They have little horny
spines on their bills and on their tongues. These spines serve as fences to prevent the escape
of the minute creatures which the flamingo scoops up with its bill. You notice the spines
on the tongue are pointed backward toward the throat; and that's a help&mdash;to the flamingo,
I mean, for once on that tongue there's no turning back.</p>

<h5><a name="A_LATE_BIRD_BUT_HE_GETS_THE_WORM" id="A_LATE_BIRD_BUT_HE_GETS_THE_WORM">A LATE BIRD, BUT HE GETS THE WORM</a></h5>

<p>Another of the long-nosed earth workers, as curious in
his make-up as the flamingoes, is the kiwi of New Zealand.
Like the flamingo, the kiwi uses his queer bill to get his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
living out of the soil. You've heard the saying "it's the
early bird that gets the worm"; but while this is true of
most birds it doesn't apply to the kiwis. Although they
live on worms, as does Mr. Early Bird of the proverb, they
do their feeding by night.</p>

<p>And such a funny thing for a bird to do, the kiwis go
about with their noses to the ground like a dog smelling
after a rat. The reason they do this is that their nostrils
are situated, not next to their heads, as in most birds, but
at the end of the bill&mdash;and on purpose; for they locate
their suppers, the worms in the earth, by the sense of smell,
although most birds have a very poor sense of smell. Just
after sunset, you'll see the kiwis moving about softly (as
if they were afraid of scaring away the worms!), and with
the tips of their bills against the ground.</p>

<p>"Sniff! Sniff!" (You actually can hear them sniff.)</p>

<p>There, he's found one! His bill is not only long, but
bends rather easily and that's why, perhaps, he's able to
follow up so closely the hints he gets from his nose as to
the location of worms, for he usually brings the worm out
whole, and not all pulled apart as the robins do it sometimes.
He works in soft earth, where most worms are found,
and generally drives his bill in up to his forehead. If all
goes well he pulls it right out with the worm at the end;
but if there is any likelihood of an accident, the kiwi gently
moves his head and neck to and fro until he has the soil
loosened up and so clears the way. Once the worm is fairly
out of the ground, he throws up his head with a jerk and
swallows it whole.</p>

<p>Because they roam about so much at night, the kiwis
sleep much of the day. You'll find them in thickets or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
in among the forested hills, where they make their homes.
Sometimes, however, you'll see one standing, leaning on
his long bill, like a street-idler propping himself up with
his cane. If you disturb him, he yawns, as if to say:</p>

<p>"Oh, these bores! Why can't they let a fellow alone?"</p>

<p>But don't you go too far and annoy him or he'll get real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
peevish and strike at you with his foot.</p>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Kiwi drill the earth every day&mdash;or
rather every night&mdash;in their search for worms, but Lady
Kiwi does all the excavating when it comes to making the
nest. This she does by digging a tunnel, generally under
the roots of a tree fern. There she lays two eggs and then
her family cares are practically over for the time being,
since it is the male kiwi who does most of the setting.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei181" name="imagei181"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i181.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MR. HORNBILL LOCKS THE DOOR</p>
<p class="ctext">In Africa, Southern Asia, and the East Indies live the Hornbills. After the nest is built
and the eggs laid in the hollow of some big tree like that, Mrs. Hornbill begins to set; and
Mr. Hornbill, to protect her from enemies, walls up the nest with mud&mdash;all but that hole
through which she puts her bill and gets food from the devoted father and husband.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Other long-nosed tunnel diggers you must have seen
many a time when you've been fishing, for they are fishers,
too&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher. Their home is at the end
of a tunnel in the banks of the stream where they do their
fishing.</p>

<p>While we're visiting them and making a study of their
household arrangements, it's a good thing for us that we're
not kingfishers ourselves; for if there's anything that makes
the kingfishers mad it's to have other kingfishers fooling
around their place or even coming into their front yard.
Each pair of kingfishers lays claim to the part of the creek
in the neighborhood of their nest, as their fishing preserve,
and woe betide any other kingfisher that trespasses!</p>

<p>Human fishermen and hunters give it out sometimes
that kingfishers eat big fish that might otherwise be caught
with a hook or a seine, but the fact is these birds catch
only minnows and little shallow-water fish.</p>

<p>In digging the tunnels for their nests the two birds work
together, and these tunnels are sometimes fifteen feet long.
So you see that with kingfishers scattered around the world
as they are&mdash;some 200 species in all&mdash;they must have done
an enormous amount of ploughing in the course of time;
to say nothing of what they have done in the way of enriching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the soil with fish-bones, one of the very best of all
fertilizers.</p>

<p>The kingfisher's nest wouldn't be at all attractive to
some birds&mdash;the swallows, for example, who are so particular
about having feather-beds. It has just a hard-earth
floor like the cabins of the American pioneers, but the little
kingfishers are perfectly contented and happy; for their
meals are very plentiful, fairly regular, and the fish are
always fresh.</p>


<h5>FISHING DAYS AND OTHER DAYS</h5>

<p>But some days even the kingfishers don't have fish for
dinner. Instead they serve crayfish and frogs. This is
on cloudy days, or when the wind is stiff and the water
rough. On such days even the keen eyes of the kingfisher
can't see a fish or make out exactly where the fish is when
he does see one. But on clear, quiet days, you should see
him fish. He often dives from a perch fifty feet or more
above the creek and strikes the water so hard you'd think
it would knock the breath out of him. But up he comes
with his fish, nearly every time!</p>

<p>Of course he misses occasionally, but just think of seeing
a fish that far away&mdash;under the water, mind you; and
not a big fish, but a little minnow, only two or three inches
long.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="II_Under_the_Oven-Birds_Friendly_Roof" id="II_Under_the_Oven-Birds_Friendly_Roof"></a>II. Under the Oven-Bird's Friendly Roof</span></h4>

<p>Another great little farmer is the oven-bird. We can't
afford to miss him and his wife for anything; and although
we have to go to South America to meet them,
we'll do it. So here we are! The oven-birds build a nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of clay mixed with some hair or grass or real fine little roots.
This nest, when it's all done&mdash;it takes a good while to build
it&mdash;is so big you'd hardly believe it was the home of so
small a bird. It's a dome-shaped affair, like a Dutch
oven. In the United States we have what we call an "oven-bird,"
too&mdash;one of the water-thrushes; but as its dome-shaped
nest is made of grass and leaves and has no clay
in it, we will not include this bird among the feathered
farmers. The oven-bird of South America knows how to
build its dome of clay without any scaffolding, which isn't
easy.</p>


<h5>OVEN-BIRD DOORS AND THE FRIENDLY ROAD</h5>

<p>While the big flamingoes are so shy, the little oven-birds
don't care who sees them&mdash;provided they can see <i>him</i> first.
This is possibly because they want to keep an eye on any
suspicious movements; for they make it an invariable
rule to build so that their front doors will face the road.
But really I think they do this, not because they are suspicious,
but because they want to be neighborly and arrange
their homes so they can sit on their front stoop and
watch the crowd go by. They not only have their doors
where they can see what's going on, but they nearly always
build near the country road or the village street,
and in the most conspicuous place they can find, instead
of staying off by themselves in those vast, lonesome woods
of Brazil where they lived before man came.</p>

<p>When a nest is to be built the oven-bird picks up the
first likely-looking root fibre, or a horsehair, or a hair from
an old cow's tail, carries it to some pond or puddle and,
with this binding material, works bits of mud into a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
ball about the size of a filbert. Then he flies with this pellet
to the place where the nest is going up. With clay balls
like this laid down and then worked together, the two birds
make the floor of their little house. On the outer edge of
the floor they build up the walls. These walls they gradually
incline inward, just as the Eskimos build their snow-block
huts, until they form a dome with a little hole in it.
The last little ball they bring goes to fill that little hole
and then the house is done, so far as the walls and roof
are concerned. Next, a front door is cut through the wall
that faces the road.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei185" name="imagei185"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i185.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE FRIENDLY DOOR THAT FACES THE ROAD</p>
<p class="ctext">Oven-birds make it a rule to build their adobe homes so that the front door will face the road.
And they nearly always build near the road or the village street. Neighborly little creatures!</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the front door a partition is built reaching nearly
to the back of the house, shutting off the front room from
the family bedroom. After the eggs are laid Papa Oven-bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
stays in the front room&mdash;or thereabouts&mdash;while
mamma sets in the back room. The object of the little
partition seems to be to protect mother and the eggs and,
when they come, the babies from wind and rain. When
the four or five baby birds arrive both papa and mamma
put in most of their time, of course, feeding them.</p>

<p>The nests of the oven-birds weigh eight or nine pounds.
The work of these little feathered farmers and their wives
reminds us in more ways than one of that of Mrs. Mason-Bee,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
but they evidently have quite different notions about
housekeeping; for, although their residences are so big,
the oven-birds would evidently rather build than clean
house, while with Mrs. Bee it's just the other way. The
nests of the oven-birds are so thick and strong they often
stand for two or three years in spite of the rains; but the
birds build a new nest every year, nevertheless.</p>


<h4><a name="III._THE_MOUND-BUILDERS" id="III._THE_MOUND-BUILDERS"><span class="smcap">III. The Mound-Builders</span></a></h4>

<p>Another class of birds that have a fancy for big dome-like
nests are the mound-birds. We find them in Australia,
the Philippines, and the islands of the South Seas.
Their scientific nickname is <i>Megapoddidae</i>, the "big-footed."
It's with their big feet that they pile immense
heaps of leaves, twigs, and rotten wood over their eggs.</p>

<p>And what for, do you suppose?</p>

<p>To hatch them! This heap of material not only absorbs
the heat of the sun, but, in decaying, makes heat of
its own. These mounds, of course, contribute tons and
tons of fertilizer to the soil, but what interests the birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
is that these warm heaps hatch their eggs. It's a kind of
an incubator system, you see. As it is with many tens of
thousands of our own little chickens, these days, the baby
megapodes are born orphans. That heap of dead sticks,
leaves, and earth is all the mother they ever know. As
soon as the mother birds have laid their eggs in the mounds
and covered them up, they go off gossiping with other
lady megapodes, and don't bother their heads any more
about their babies.</p>


<h5>WHY LITTLE BIG FOOT NEVER SAYS "MAMMA"</h5>

<p>But it really doesn't seem to matter. It's more of a
question of sentiment than anything else, for the babies
get on very well by themselves. When the time comes they
not only make their own way out of the shell, as all birds
do, but they work their way up through the rubbish-heap
and run off at once into the woods to hunt something to eat.</p>

<p>It's all right, after all, I suppose; but if <i>I</i> were a little
mound-builder's baby, I'd rather have a mamma that
would stay around and go places with me, wouldn't you?</p>

<p>There's one nice thing about these mamma mound-builders,
though; they're so neighborly and sociable. It's
like a regular old-fashioned quilting party to see them
build a nest. The birds look like turkeys, and one of the
species is called the "brush turkey," but they are no bigger
than an ordinary chicken&mdash;than a rather small chicken,
in fact. When I tell you, then, that these mounds of theirs
are often six feet high and twelve feet across in the widest
part, the middle, you can see it takes good team-work
to put them up.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei189" name="imagei189"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i189.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BRUSH TURKEYS BUILDING THEIR INCUBATORS</p>
<p class="ctext">It's like an old-fashioned quilting party&mdash;the co-operative mound building of the brush
turkeys. The text tells you about that back kick of theirs.</p>
</div></div>


<p>So a lot of the lady mound-builders get together in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
woodsy places, where there's plenty of leaves and twigs
lying around and together build a mound. One will run
forward a little way, rake up and grasp a handful of sticks
and leaves&mdash;I mean to say a footful&mdash;and kick it backward.
The motion is much like that of an old hen scratching.
Then another bird gathers a footful; then another,
and soon they are all throwing the rubbish toward the
same pile; all as busy as a sewing-circle, but&mdash;curiously
enough&mdash;nobody saying a word! Before the mounds are
quite done, they all begin laying their eggs in them; as
many as forty or fifty, before they are through.</p>

<p>Some species frequent scrubby jungles along the sea.
These scratch a slanting hole in the sandy soil about three
feet deep and lay their eggs on the bottom, loosely covering
up the mouth of the hole with a collection of sticks,
shells, and seaweed. The natives say these birds, before
they leave, go carefully over the footprints leading to this
treasure-house, scratch them out and make tracks leading
in various directions away from the nest. And all species
lay their eggs at night. You see why, don't you? They're
just that cautious.</p>


<h5><a name="SUCH_AN_EGG_FROM_SUCH_A_BIRD" id="SUCH_AN_EGG_FROM_SUCH_A_BIRD"></a>SUCH AN EGG FROM SUCH A BIRD</h5>

<p>But if you should find one of their nests full of brick-red
eggs you'd never guess who laid them, they're so big!
Away back in 1673, an English missionary to China who
had stopped off at the Philippines, on his way, wrote a
little book when he got back home about where he had
been and what he had seen, and he just couldn't get over
the wonder of the mound-builders. Among other things
he says, in one place in his book:</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is a very singular bird called Tabon. What I and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
many more admired<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is that being in body no bigger than an ordinary
chicken, it lays an egg larger than a goose's."</p></blockquote>

<p>"So," he adds, "the egg is bigger than the bird itself!"</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="IV_THE_SWALLOWS" id="IV_THE_SWALLOWS"></a>IV. THE SWALLOWS</span></h4>

<p>To make the acquaintance of either the mound-builders
or those dear little oven-birds&mdash;<i>aren't</i> they dear?&mdash;we must
be travellers, of course, for with their short wings neither
the mound-builders nor the oven-birds ever could come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
all the way up here to see us. But another feathered farmer&mdash;and,
like the oven-bird, a clay-worker and most
neighborly&mdash;everybody knows; the swallow. Like Kim,
the swallow is the little friend of all the world.</p>

<p>Swallows of one kind and another are found everywhere&mdash;almost
everywhere that people can live; usually where
people <i>do</i> live. And if all the soil they've helped pulverize
and mix&mdash;even since the days when the swallows built
under the eaves and rafters of the ark&mdash;was spread out, it
would easily make another Egypt, I do believe!</p>

<p>But, speaking of the way swallows take to human society,
do you know where our barn-swallows came from?
They were originally cliff-dwellers away out West. The
early explorers found enormous collections of their nests
plastered all over the perpendicular cliffs and along the
bluffs. Just as soon, however, as the country settled up
and men put up barns these little cliff-dwellers, deserting
rocks and bluffs, began building their bottle-shaped nests
under the eaves. The swallows live on insects&mdash;including
squash-bugs, stink-bugs, shield-bugs, and jumping plant-lice;
and that's supposed to be one of the reasons for the
curious fact that they left their ancient family seats&mdash;they
found so many more insects about the barns and the farmer's
fields and the gardens and the orchards.</p>


<h5>TINY SOIL MILLS OF THE BABY SWALLOW</h5>

<p>Haven't you often watched them and listened to them,
diving and chattering around the barn in their busy season;
that is to say, in the spring and summer time? Then the
air is full of insects and is fairly woven with their darting
wings. Some keep busy picking up the insects that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
always hovering about in a barnyard, while others dash
away to some near-by marsh or to the meadow or to the
creek. Over the grain-fields they go, over the meadows
and back again straight to the nest where downy babies
are cheeping for them. The parents feed them, stop and
chatter a moment, and then off they go. Follow that one
down to the marsh. See how she flies high, round and
round in circles, and then swoops for an insect. She missed
him! Then she wheels, darts up&mdash;darts down&mdash;to right&mdash;to
left. There, she's got him! Then off like an arrow to
the nest. The soft-bodied insects are chosen and chewed
up for the babies, while the parents eat the tougher ones.
And to help digestion they give the babies little bits of
gravel, although they don't use it themselves. So, in grinding
up this gravel the baby birds help make soil before
they are old enough to do any nest-building.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei191" name="imagei191"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i191.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE SAND MARTIN AND HIS HOME IN THE BANK</p>

</div></div>

<p>You've noticed, of course, that all the swallows about
a barn don't build under the eaves. Some build under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the rafters inside the barn. That isn't just a matter of
taste; it's family tradition. The eave-builders are descendants
of the cliff-swallows, while the birds known to
bird students as "barn" swallows build under the rafters.</p>

<p>But they don't take to the fine, new modern barns&mdash;all
spick and span&mdash;the barn-swallows don't. If there's an
old gray barn with doors that never shut quite snug, a
board off here and there, and several panes in the cob-webbed
windows broken out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, just the thing!" say Mr. and Mrs. Swallow, and
they turn their backs on the new barn and proceed to build
their cute little nests of clay among the rafters of that old
tumbled-down affair. In their preference for the old gray
barns, the swallows are like the artists, the painters that
Mr. Dooley told about. He was talking about artists to
his friend, Mr. Hennessey:</p>

<p>"I don't mane the kind of painther that paints yer fine
new barn," said Mr. Dooley. "I mane the kind of painther
that makes a pitcher of yer <i>old</i> barn and wants to charge
ye more'n the barn itself is worth."</p>


<h5>WHY ARTISTS AND SWALLOWS PREFER OLD BARNS</h5>

<p>The reason the artists prefer old barns is that they look
better in pictures, but the reason the barn-swallow shows
the same taste is that, with windows that have panes in
them and doors that shut tight you'd no sooner start to
build a nest than, coming back with a pellet of clay, or
bringing a feather for the little feather-bed, you'd be liable
to find the door shut and you could no more get in until
chore time than you could open the time-lock in the First
National Bank. And suppose there were babies and you'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
just <i>got</i> to get back&mdash;you see it wouldn't do at all!</p>

<p>But both the barn-swallows and the old gray barns will
be seen only in pictures before long, if things keep on; what
with these new barns and the cats always trying to catch
the few swallows there are left&mdash;when you're swooping
low to catch a squash-bug, say&mdash;and those hateful sparrows
that tear your nest to pieces. And for several years
swallows were killed by thousands to make ornaments for
women's hats until this shameful business was stopped
by law!</p>

<p>On the Pacific Coast, if you're out there even as early
as March, you'll see a purplish-bronze swallow, with bronze-green
markings. These swallows make a specialty of
orchard insects and that's why, perhaps, they build under
the eaves of the farmhouse rather than the barn. But,
like the rest of the swallow family, they think nothing
quite so nice as a bed of feathers to raise babies in, and
they know as well as the cliff-swallows and the barn-swallow
that a barnyard is a great place for feathers.</p>

<p>And besides, there's a man out there, in one place, that
keeps a supply of feathers just to give away when the
swallows are nesting. Watch him, over on the hillside.
He takes a little bunch of feathers and throws them up
into the air from his open hand. A swallow skims by and
catches one of these feathers before it touches the ground.
But soon the word passes along:</p>

<p>"Here's that nice man with the feathers!"</p>

<p>And, pretty soon, there are a half-dozen in the game.
They flit closer and closer to that generous hand, seizing
the feathers almost the moment they are in the air. Then
one, bolder than the rest, snatches a feather right from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the man's thumb and finger. The little rogue!</p>

<p>By the way, do you know who that man is? It's Mr.
W. L. Finley, State Ornithologist of Oregon. "Our little
brothers of the air," as Olive Thorne Miller calls the birds,
are getting to be so much appreciated, not only as the
friends of man, but for their beauty and the usefulness of
their lives, that both our State and national governments
have laws to protect them, and such men as Mr. Finley
are employed to look after their interests.</p>

<p>Of course, he doesn't <i>have</i> to furnish feather-beds for
the baby swallows&mdash;he just does!</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want to get better acquainted with ostriches you should
read Olive Thorne Miller's "African Nine Feet High," in "Little
Folks in Feathers and Fur." Carpenter deals with the ostrich in
his "How the World is Clothed" and in his "Geographic Reader
on Africa"; Johonnott's "Neighbors with Wings and Fins" gives
a chapter to "Giants of Desert and Plain," among which you may
be sure he includes the ostrich.</p>

<p>Allen, in writing about "Some Strange Nurseries" ("Nature's
Work Shop"), tells why it is Papa Ostrich has most to do with the
hatching of the eggs when the sun is not on the job.</p>

<p>Lucas, in his "Animals of the Past," speaks of ostriches and crocodiles
as the nearest living relatives of&mdash;guess what&mdash;the dinosaurs!
(Yet look at the dinosaur in "The Strange Adventures of a Pebble"
and see if you can't make out a good deal of the ostrich and the
crocodile in him.)</p>

<p>But, speaking of Papa Ostrich's parental duties, did you know
that it's <i>Mr.</i> Puffin, and not <i>Mrs.</i> Puffin, who digs the family burrow?
Arabella Buckley's "Morals of Science" tells that and
many other interesting things about devoted husbands among the
birds, including how Papa Nightingale feeds Mamma Nightingale.</p>

<p>In the "Children's Hour," Volume 7, page 310, you will find an
interesting article about the puffins of Iceland.</p>

<p>"The Romance of Animal Arts and Crafts" tells about one of
the feathered clay-workers, the nuthatch of Syria, and why he
makes his nest look like a rock. These nuthatches love to build
so well that they often make nests that they never use; and they
even help put up nests for their neighbors!</p>

<p>This book also gives interesting details about the hornbill, and
how and why he walls up his mate in her nest in the hollow of a
tree. Father Hornbill, of course, gets all the meals for Mother
Hornbill, while she's setting. She simply <i>can't</i> get out, and you
should see him by the time the babies are old enough to leave the
nest. He's worn to a shadow!</p>

<p>Rooks, it seems, do a little digging under certain circumstances.
Selous tells about it in his "Bird Life Glimpses." In this book you
will find a delightful description of martins building. It almost
makes you want to <i>be</i> a martin. It also tells about the work of the
sand martins. You will hardly believe how fast they work. The
house-martin's nest is more elaborate than the swallow's. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
book tells why the house-martins begin work so early in the morning,
and why they have to delay their nest-building if the weather
is either too wet or too dry.</p>

<p>White, in his famous "Natural History of Selbourne," tells how
worried he was because certain swallows just <i>would</i> build facing
southeast and southwest.</p>

<p>Birds, besides being workers of the soil, are great sowers of seeds.
Darwin tells how he reared eighty seedlings from a single little clod
on a bird's foot. What do you suppose he did that for? You just
look it up in the index to his "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2009">Origin of Species</a>."</p>

<p>Doesn't it seem funny that one of the little farmer birds&mdash;a burrower&mdash;should
go into partnership with a lizard? There is one in
New Zealand that does that very thing. He is called the titi.
What the titi does for the lizard is to provide him with a home in
his burrow, but what do you suppose the lizard does in return to
pay for his lodging? Read about it in Ingersoll's "Wit of the
Wild," in the chapter on "Animal Partnerships."</p>

<p>Do you know why the ph&oelig;be bird so often uses moss in building
her nest? And how the ph&oelig;bes that make green nests keep them
green? And how Mrs. P. puts a stone roof on her house? You
will find all about it in "Wit of the Wild."</p>

<p>The same chapter, "The Ph&oelig;be at Home," tells why the ph&oelig;be
bird took to building under bridges, and why she builds in a carriage
shed instead of a barn, as the barn-swallow does.</p>

<p>"Bird Life," by Chapman, is a guide to the study of our common
birds. The beauty about this book is that it has seventy-five
full-page plates in the natural colors, with brief descriptions, so
that all you have to do is to bring the <i>mind</i> picture of the bird you
have seen alongside the picture in the book, and there's the answer!
Nobody has written more delightful books on birds than Olive
Thorne Miller. "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/27277">Little Brothers of the Air</a>" is one of them.
You couldn't keep your hands off a book with a name like that,
could you? Then there is her "Children's Book of Birds," "True
Bird Stories," illustrated by Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and "Little
Folks in Feathers and Fur," which, as you can see, goes outside the
bird family. John Burroughs's "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4203">Wake Robin</a>" deals not with
robins alone, but with birds and bird habits in general.</p>

<p>But the greatest book about birds&mdash;the wonder of the bird and
his relations to the whole animal world&mdash;is very properly called
"The Bird," by C. William Beebe, who is at the head of the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
department of the great New York Zoo. Among other things it
tells:</p>

<p>How Nature practised drawing&mdash;so to speak&mdash;for years before
she could finally make a proper bird. (If you have ever tried to
draw a bird from memory and realized what a bad job you
made out of it, you will sympathize with her.) How they know
that the earliest birds Nature made, as well as being very homely,
weren't at all smart; not to be mentioned in the same breath with
clever Jim Crow, for example. How "a bird's swaddling clothes
and his first full-dress are cut from the same piece," the very words
of the book. About certain birds that have one set of wings to
play in and a new set for flying, like a child wearing jumpers to
save his nice clothes! About the world of interesting things you
can discover with the bones of a boiled chicken.</p>

<p>And so on for nearly five hundred pages, and as many illustrations;
the most striking collection of pictures explaining birds that
I ever saw.</p></blockquote>

and the jelly in the jelly-glasses, and the jam, and the preserves&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
helped make them all.</p>

<p>"And we've been working for you almost since the world
began; almost, but not quite&mdash;for the earliest plants, the
Lichens, for example&mdash;didn't have true roots.</p>

<p>"Yes, and&mdash;well, I don't want to say anything&mdash;Mr.
Lichen has been a good neighbor&mdash;but he never did amount
to much; never could. No plant can amount to much
without roots. But with roots and a good start a plant
can do almost anything&mdash;raise flowers and fruit and nuts,
and help grow trees so tall you can hardly see the tops of
them. And, it isn't alone what we do for the plants we
belong to, but for the soil, for other plants and roots that
come after we're dead and gone. For them we even split
up rocks, and so start these rocks on their way to becoming
soil."</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">I. All in the Day's Work</span></h4>

<p>It's a fact. Roots do split rocks. Hundreds of times
I've been in the cracks of rocks that were split in that way.
I mean right when the splitting was going on. This happened
oftenest where trees grew on the stony flanks of
mountains. Seeds of the pines, say, dropped in crevices
by the wind, sprout in the soil they find there, and then,
as these shoots grow up into trees, the enlarged roots, in
their search for more soil, thrust themselves deeper and
deeper into the original lodging-place, and so split even big
rocks. The tap-roots do the heaviest part of this pioneer
work. After the older and larger roots have broken up
the rock, the smaller roots and fibres, feeling their way
about among the stones, enter the smaller openings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
by their growth divide the rock again and again.</p>

<p>But it's a lot of hard work for little return, so far as these
early settlers are concerned; just a bare living. All these
rock fragments, in the course of the years, become soil,
but the amount of decay is small in the lifetime of the tree
that does the breaking.</p>

<p>A root, as you doubtless know, tapers. This enables it
to enter a rock crevice like a wedge. As it pushes its way
in farther and farther it is growing bigger and bigger, and
it is this steady pressure that breaks the rock. Even the
tiny root of a bean grows with a force of several pounds,
and the power exerted by the growth of big roots is something
tremendous. At Amherst Agricultural College, one
time, they harnessed up a squash to see how hard it could
push by growing. From a force of sixty pounds, when it
was a mere baby, what do you suppose its push amounted
to when it had reached full squashhood in October?
Nearly 5,000 pounds; over two tons!</p>

<p class="caption">HOW A LITTLE ROOT SPLIT A GRANITE BLOCK</p>
<p class="ctext">The little winged seed from which this pine-tree grew was carried by the wind one day
into a tiny crack in that big granite block. As the treelet grew the tap root split the rock,
penetrated to the earth below and fed the trunk until it became, as you see, a tree 40 feet
high and 18 inches in diameter!</p>
</div></div>


<p>But don't think because roots can and do split rocks,
if need be, that they go about looking for such hard work.
On the contrary. In travelling through the soil they always
choose the easiest route, the softest spots. They
use their brains as well as their muscles, and what they do
with these brains is almost unbelievable.</p>

<p>Yet the roots are such modest, retiring folks, always
hiding, that it was a long time before the wise men&mdash;the
science people&mdash;found out what all they do. It took a
lot of science people and the wisest&mdash;including the great
Darwin&mdash;to get the story, and they haven't got it all yet,
as you will see. It was Darwin who first thought of having
Mr. Root write out his autobiography&mdash;or part of it&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
story of his travels; for he does travel, not only forward&mdash;as
everybody knows&mdash;but around and around. A
regular globe-trotter!</p>

<p class="caption">WHY BABY PLANTS BACK INTO THE WORLD</p>
<p class="ctext">Most plants back into the world out of the seed like that. Why? To protect their tender
first leaves. Suppose you were taking some very valuable thing, easily injured&mdash;baby
brother, say&mdash;through a swinging door and you had to use both hands to carry him. You
wouldn't open the door by pushing that dear, little tender head of his against it, would you?
You'd open it by backing through.</p>
</div></div>


<p>Mr. Darwin was a wonderful hand at that sort of thing&mdash;getting
nature people to tell their stories. He was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
inventor, like Mr. Edison; only, instead of inventing telephones
for human beings to talk with, he invented ways
of talking for nature people. You saw how he fixed it so
that the earthworms could tell what they knew about
geometry and botany. Well, in the case of the roots,
what did he do one day but take a piece of glass, smoke
it all over with lampblack&mdash;you'd have thought he was
going to look at an eclipse&mdash;and then set it so that Mr.
Root could use it as a kind of writing-desk. In a hitching,
jerky sort of way roots turn round and round as they
grow forward. In the ground, to be sure, a root can't move
as freely nor as fast as it did out in the open and over this
smooth glass, but it does turn, slowly, little by little. The
very first change in a growing seed is the putting out of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
tiny root, and from the first this root feels its way along,
like one trying to find something in a dark room. Thus
it searches out the most mellow soil and also any little
cracks down which it can pass.</p>

<p>"Here's a fine opening for
a live young chap," we can
imagine one of these roots
saying when it comes to an
empty earthworm's burrow or
a vacancy left by some other
little root that has decayed
and gone away. Roots always
help themselves, when they
can, to ready-made openings,
and it is this round-and-round
motion that enables them to
find these openings.</p>

<p>But even this isn't all. A
root not only moves forward
and bends down&mdash;so that it
may always keep under cover
and away from the light&mdash;but it has a kind of rocking motion,
swinging back and forth, like a winding river between
its banks, and for a somewhat similar reason.</p>

<p>"It's looking for a soft spot!" says the high school
boy, "just as the river does."</p>


<h5>NO HIT-OR-MISS METHODS FOR MR. ROOT</h5>

<p>Exactly. But not in the sense that this phrase is used in
slang. The root has certain work to do, and it does it in
the quickest and best way. It can get food more quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
out of mellow soil than out of hard, and so it constantly
hunts it up. I mean just that&mdash;<i>hunts it up</i>. For it isn't
by aimless rocking back and forth that roots just <i>happen</i>
upon the mellow places. It's the other way around; it's
from a careful feeling along for the mellow places that the
rocking motion results.</p>

<p>"But how on earth do the roots do this? What makes
them do it?"</p>

<p>That's what any live boy would ask, wouldn't he? So
you may be sure that's what the science people asked, and
this is the answer:</p>

<p>The roots, like all parts of the plant&mdash;like all parts of
boys and girls and grown people, for the matter of that&mdash;are
made up of little cells. Well, these cells, first on one
side of the root and then the other, enlarge, and so pump
in an extra flow of sap. Now, as we know, the sap contains
food for the plant, just as blood contains food for
our bodies; and more food means more growth. So the
side of the root where the cells first swell out grows fastest
and thus pushes the root over on the opposite side. Then
the cells on this opposite side swell, and the root is turned
in the other direction again. So it goes&mdash;right and left,
up and down. And when these two motions&mdash;the up and
down and right and left&mdash;are put together, don't you see
what you get? The round-and-round motion!</p>

<p>Precisely the same thing happened right now when you
turned your finger round and round to imitate the motion
of the root. (I saw you!) The muscles that did the work
swelled up first on one side and then on the other, just as
they do when you bend your elbow, when you walk, when
you breathe, when you laugh.</p>

<p>And more than that: You know how tired you get if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
you keep using one set of muscles all the time&mdash;in sawing
fire-wood, for example. Yet you can play ball by the hour
and never think of being tired until it's all over; because,
for one thing, you are constantly bringing new muscles
into action as you go to bat, as you strike, as you run bases.
It's the same way with the roots, it seems. For
the theory is that after the cells on one side have
swelled, they rest; then the cells on the other side
get to work.</p>

<p>"But what starts the movement?" you may say.
"The idea of moving my arms and legs starts in
my brain."</p>


<h5>WHERE MR. ROOT KEEPS HIS BRAINS</h5>

<p>Just so again. The root has a brain, too, or what
answers for a brain. And the root's brain, is in its
head; at least in the vicinity of its nose&mdash;that is to
say, its tip. It's the tip that first
finds out which side of the road is
best, and passes the word back to the
part of the root just behind it to
bend this way or that. It's also the
tip that feels the pull of gravity and
knows that it's the business of roots
to keep under cover. And Mr. Root just <i>will</i> have it that
way! You can't change his mind. Mr. Darwin tried it
and he couldn't; although he finally changed human people's
minds a lot.</p>

<div class="figright">
<a id="imagei205" name="imagei205"></a>

<p class="caption">WHERE MR. ROOT<br />
WEARS HIS CAP</p>
<p class="ctext">A root wears its cap right
where you do&mdash;over its brain
department; that is to say,
the tip. It is called the "root
cap" and protects the tip
from injury.</p>
</div>

<p>This is how he tried it on a root. He took a bean with
a little root that had just started out into the world. He
cut off the tip and then set the bean so that the root stuck
straight up. It continued to grow that way for some little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
time. Finally, however, a new tip had formed. Then
there was a general waking up, as if the tip said to the rest
of the root:</p>

<p>"Here, here, this will never do! Where are you going?
You must bend <i>down</i>!"</p>

<p>Anyhow that's what the root proceeded to do. One
side seemed to stop growing, almost, while the other side
grew rapidly and so the bending was done.</p>

<p>"Did you ever! But how does the tip send back word?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" says the science man; say all the
science men, even to this day. "We don't know yet just
<i>how</i> it's done. But we're studying these things all the
time, and we'll know more about it by and by. Meanwhile,
perhaps you'll tell <i>us</i> why you say 'ouch' and pull
your finger away when you touch something hot."</p>

<p>"Oh," you reply, "I say 'ouch' because it hurts; and
teacher and the Physiology say my arm pulls my hand
away because my head tells it to."</p>

<p>"Yes, but how does the head make the arm do the pulling?
What's the connection?" says the science man.</p>

<p>Well, I guess we'll have to tell him we don't know, won't
we?</p>

<p>But all the root's brains aren't in the tip, any more than
all <i>our</i> brains are in our heads. Scattered through our
bodies, you know, are <i>little</i> brains, the ganglia, that control
different parts of the body. So it is with roots. For
instance, a root at a short distance from the tip, is sensitive
to the touch of hard objects in such a way that it bends
toward them instead of turning away, as the tip does. The
result is that when a root comes to a pebble, say, under
ground, the sides of the root press close up to the sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the pebble&mdash;turn around corners sharply, by the shortest
route&mdash;and so get over the obstruction as soon as possible
and resume their course in the soil.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei207" name="imagei207"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i207.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BUT THEY COULDN'T CHANGE ITS MIND</p>
<p class="ctext">Some sprouting seedlings were attached to a disk like that, and when the roots started to
grow down, the disk was turned to make them point upwards. But, no Sir! The roots just
<i>wouldn't</i> grow upward. They turned downward. Every time!</p>
</div></div>

<p>And different parts of a plant's root system respond in
different ways to the pull of gravity, and some don't respond
at all. The tap-root, for example, which always
grows down, has roots growing out from it horizontally.
They just won't grow any other way, and yet this is also
supposed to be due to the influence of gravity. Then, from
these horizontal roots, grow out a third set, and they don't
seem to pay any attention whatever to gravity. They
grow out in all directions&mdash;every which way&mdash;so that if
there is a bit to eat anywhere in the neighborhood they
are reasonably sure to find it. You see it works out all
right.</p>

<p>When a plant first begins to peep into the world out of
that wonder box we call the seed, it's the root, as we know,
that does the peeping; it comes first. And its first business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
is to get a firm hold in the soil. So a lot of fine hairlike
fibres grow right and left and all around and take a
firm grip. There is an acid in the root that dissolves whatever
the root touches that has any food in it&mdash;including
pebbles and old bones&mdash;and so makes a kind of sticky stuff
that hardens. In this way these fibrous roots not only
get good meals for themselves and the rest of the plant,
but they hold the plant firmly in the soil, against the strain
of the winds. They also give the tap-root something to
brace its back against, as it were, while it pushes down for
water, for the moisture in the damper portion of the soil
beneath.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, a seed merely lying loose on
the ground is lifted up by its first little root in its effort to
poke its nose into the soil. But Nature makes provisions
for covering seeds up. They are covered by the castings
of the earthworms, the dirt thrown out by burrowing animals
and scratching birds. Some seeds fall into cracks
where the ground is very dry and others are washed into
them by the rains; while these as well as seeds lying on the
surface are covered by the washings of the rain. Then
come the roots that grip the soil.</p>

<p>Always growing just back of the tip, are thousands of
root-hairs, as fine as down. These get food from the soil.
They soon disappear from the older parts of the root, so
that it stops gathering food itself and puts in all its time
passing along to the stem and leaves the food gathered by
the finer and younger roots. This is why plants are so apt
to wilt if you aren't careful when transplanting them; the
root-hairs get broken off. For the same reason, corn, after
it grows tall, is not ploughed deeply. The fine roots reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
out between the rows and the ploughshare would cut them
off.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">II. Mr. Root's Presence of Mind</span></h4>

<p>All these things and more the roots do in their daily
work&mdash;in the ordinary course of business. And it's wonderful
enough. Don't you think so? But there are even
stranger things to tell; things that would almost make us
believe roots have what in human beings we call "presence
of mind." That is to say, the faculty of thinking just what
to do when something happens that one isn't looking for;
when the house takes fire, for example, or the baby upsets
the ink.</p>

<p class="caption">THREE SCHOOLS OF STRATEGY</p>

</div></div>


<h5>A ROOT'S WAY OF CROSSING A ROAD</h5>

<p>Take the case of tree roots crossing a country road for
a drink of water. They do it just as you or I would, I'll
be bound. Just suppose you and I were roots of a big tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
that wanted to reach the moist bank of a stream, and there
was a hard road-bed between. We can't go over the top,
and the road-bed is so hard we can't go straight through
on our natural level so we'll just stoop down and go under,
won't we? That's exactly what the roots do. They dip
down until they get under the hard-packed soil, and then
up they come again on the other side and into the moist
bank they started for.</p>

<p>The roots of each kind of plant or tree have their natural
level; that's one reason, as we know, why so many different
kinds of plants&mdash;grass, trees, bushes, and things&mdash;get
on so well together in the fields and woods. The tree roots
that we have just seen crossing the road only went down
below their natural level because they had to, as if the
tip said:</p>

<p>"This soil is too hard. We can never get through. Bend
down! Bend down!"</p>

<p>So the roots bent down until they came to softer soil,
then forward, but always working up toward their natural
level, and so it was at their natural level they came out on
the other side.</p>


<h5>A ROOT'S STRANGE ADVENTURE WITH A SHOE</h5>

<p>But here's an example of "presence of mind," that nobody
has accounted for. A good-sized root, working along
through the soil, like Little Brother Mole, to earn its board
and keep, came right up against the sole of somebody's
old shoe that had got buried in the soil. In the sole were
a lot of holes where the stitches used to be. The root
divided into many parts, and many of these smaller roots
found their way through the stitch holes. Then, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
out on the other side, these little roots got together and
travelled on, side by side!</p>

<p class="caption">HOW THE RAG BABIES TELL THE FORTUNE OF THE SEED CORN</p>
<p class="ctext">In what is popularly called "the Rag Baby Test" the seed corn is placed on squares marked
on cloth with numbers corresponding to the numbered ears. Then they are rolled up in
one of those moistened rags until they sprout.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Isn't that a story for you? But there's no accounting
for it. As we have seen, the men of science know a little
bit about how a root manages to turn round and round
and away from the light and so on, but what kind of machinery
or process is it that could tell the root if it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
split up into little threads it could get through the stitch
holes in that old boot? You can't imagine; at least, nobody
so far has thought how it was done. But it's all true.
We'll find the story and a lot of other things about the
ways of roots in one of the books we'll get acquainted with
when we come to the "Hide and Seek."</p>

<p class="ctext">The seed from Ear No. 12 came out beautifully, didn't it? That from Ear No. 13 looks
as if they were superstitious in Corn Land; but of course it was the fault of the seed and not
of the number.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Here's another example of the same thing; what we
have called "presence of mind," resourcefulness, invention.
This example is even more striking, if possible, because,
for one thing, it is a case where roots still more completely
altered their habits to save a tree struggling for its life
on a stony mountain cliff. Maeterlinck tells about it in
his picturesque and dramatic style. The subject&mdash;the
hero, as it were&mdash;of this story was a laurel-tree growing
on some cliff above a chasm at the bottom of which ran a
mountain torrent.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It was easy to see in its twisted and, so to say, writhing trunk,
the whole drama of its hard and tenacious life. The young stem
had started from a vertical plane, so that its top, instead of rising
toward the sky, bent down over the gulf. It was obliged, therefore,
notwithstanding the weight of its branches, stubbornly to
bend its disconcerted trunk into the form of an elbow close to the
rock, and thus, like a swimmer who throws back his head, by means of
an incessant will, to hold the heavy leaves straight up into the sky."</p></blockquote>

<p>This bent arm, in course of time, struggling with wind
and storm, grew so that it swelled out in knots and cords,
like muscles upholding a terrific burden. But the strain
finally proved too much. The tree began to crack at the
elbow and decay set in.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The leafy dome grew heavier, while a hidden canker gnawed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
deeper into the tragic arm that supported it in space. Then,
obeying I know not what order of instinct, two stout roots, issuing
from the trunk at some considerable distance above the elbow,
grew out and moored it to the granite wall."</p></blockquote>

<p>As if the roots, naturally so afraid of light, had heard a
frantic call for help and, regardless of everything, had
come to the rescue.</p>

<p>To be sure, certain roots&mdash;the prop-roots of corn-stalks,
for instance, as you have noticed&mdash;habitually reach from
above ground down into the soil, and serve to brace the
tall stem swaying in the winds, but trees usually have no
such roots and no such habits. Yet, here a tree seems
suddenly to have learned, somehow, that elsewhere in the
land of plants this thing is done. But how did it learn
it? Did the brownies or the gnomes tell it; or was it some
of the spirits of the wind that go everywhere and see everything?
It might have been the same wind sprites that
carry the seeds of the laurel and the pine so far up the
mountain flanks. Or it might have been the dryads, those
beautiful creatures of the wood the Greeks knew so much
about.</p>

<p>I tell you there are some mighty queer things going on
in the plant world, and perhaps Bud was right!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</p>

<blockquote><p>And, what is more, real live fairies have been found right down
in the world of roots! The science people call them "Bacteria,"
but what of that? The thing about a fairy that makes it a fairy
is that it is always changing something into something else. Isn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
that right? Well, that's exactly what is done by the bacteria on
the roots of certain kinds of plants&mdash;clover roots, for one; and the
roots of beans, peas, peanuts, and alfalfa. These plants belong to
the legume family, and if you will look up the word <i>Legumes</i> you
will find out all about these fairy factories on the roots.</p>

<p>Among other things you'll learn how small these fairies are.
Why, 100,000 of the bacteria that live on clover roots, marching
single file, wouldn't much more than reach across this typed page.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
And in their little "villages" on one system of clover roots there
are so many that all of them put together would make a city as big
as London or New York; if the bacteria were as big as people, I
mean.</p>

<p>Of course you have to take a microscope to see them&mdash;a very
powerful microscope&mdash;and even then some kinds of bacteria you
can't see until you put colored clothes on them. (Every high school
boy who has worked in the "lab" knows how this is done.)</p>

<p>And when you finally see them, a strange thing happens. You've
hardly got your eye on a little Mr. Bacteria before he's two!</p>

<p>"What's this! What's this!" you say. "Am I seeing double?"</p>

<p>You look again and he's <i>four</i>! But don't be alarmed, you aren't
seeing double; it's just the little Mr. Bacterias multiplying by division.
How they multiply by division is one of the interesting things
you can learn by looking them up.</p>

<p>But it's a good thing that the bacteria people in the little nitrogen
factories on the clover roots can get more farm-hands in this way,
for they have a lot to do, and their work is one of the most interesting
things that goes on about the place.</p>

<p>The article in the "Country Life Reader" on "The Smallest
Plant on the Farm" will tell you how important these nitrogen
farmers are.</p>

<p>You would hardly believe how great their work is, they're so
quiet about it. Do you know what a human nitrogen factory is
like? Well, for one thing, it's the <i>noisiest</i> place in the world. Men,
as do the bacteria, capture the nitrogen out of the air, but they do
it by keeping up continual thunder and rain storms in big barrels.
You will find one of these factories described in an article in <i>St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Nicholas</i>, Volume 45, page 1137.</p>

<p>But what a fuss these human factories make! Why, in growing-time,
out in the clover field, where the loudest sound you hear is
the drone of the bumblebee among the blossoms, the little bacteria
people down among the roots are making nitrogen so much cheaper
than the big noisy factories that it only costs the farmer about one-fifth
as much as the storm-barrel nitrogen. And yet, of course, it
often pays to buy the artificial nitrogen, too.</p>

<p>There are many more striking things about the habits of roots
than I have had room to tell about here, which you will find in
such books as Elliot's "Romance of Plant Life," Coulter's "Plant
Studies," Coulter's "First Book of Botany," Allen's "Story of the
Plants," Chase's "Buds, Stems and Roots," Atkinson's "First
Studies of Plant Life," Darwin's "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5605">Power of Movement in Plants</a>,"
France's "Germs of Mind in Plants," Gray's "How Plants Behave,"

Physiology," and Parsons's "Plants and Their Children."</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE AUTUMN STORES AND THE LONG
WINTER NIGHT</h3>


<p>When the caveman was still living from hand to mouth;
before he had even got as far as his first crooked stick for
a plough, and when Mrs. Cave couldn't have canned a
bean or a berry to save her life, even if she had had the
cans, a certain little farmer already knew how to get root<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
crops in the Fall and clean them and cut them and put
them away in his little barn under the ground for Winter
use.</p>

<p>Several of these forehanded folk we have already met&mdash;the
beaver and the chipmunk, among others&mdash;but since
we are now at the end of the harvest year I thought we
might spend this evening&mdash;the last but one, I am sorry
to say, that we shall be together&mdash;in a little chat about
these thrifty brothers of the wild, and how some of them
are going to spend the long Winter that begins in the Autumn
and lasts until Spring.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">I. Little Granaries under the Ground</span></h4>

<p>I was going to begin by saying that one of the most <i>fore</i>-handed
of them all has <i>six</i> feet, but as that would be almost
as bad as a pun, I decided not to. You would have
known, of course, that by people with six feet I meant the
insects.</p>


<h5><a name="ANTS_THAT_THRESH_AND_STORE" id="ANTS_THAT_THRESH_AND_STORE">ANTS THAT THRESH AND STORE</a></h5>

<p>Among the six-legged farmers, you may be sure, there
have always been many who took thought for the morrow&mdash;the
ants, for example. One can believe almost anything
of ants. If that sluggard had gone to the ant, as
wise King Solomon told him to, and learned all their ways,
he would have found, among other things, how one species
harvests the seeds of the plant known as the "shepherd's-purse,"
by twisting off the pods with its hind legs. These
members of the ant family store grains of oats, nettle, and
other plants. They pick up all the seeds they can find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the Autumn winds have already threshed for them, but
they're not the least like that lazy man who wouldn't have
the corn that was offered by kind neighbors to keep him
from starving, because it wasn't shelled. If they don't
find enough seeds on the ground when it comes time to
think about the Winter stores they climb up and gather
in the seeds themselves. On the shepherd's-purse, for
example, the ant climbs up, selects a well-filled pod which
is not sufficiently dried to have had its seeds threshed out
by the winds, takes the pod in its little jaws and then&mdash;watch
him&mdash;turns round and round on his hind legs until
he twists it off! Then with it he carefully moves down the
stem, like a baggageman carrying a big trunk from the
third apartment; only the baggageman carries the trunk
in front of him or on his shoulders, while the ant backs his
way down. Sometimes two ants work together, one twisting,
the other cutting away the fibres with its teeth. Sometimes
they drop the pods to companions waiting below,
and these other helpers never run off with it, but carry it
to the common granary; for ants always play fair.</p>

<p class="caption">HOW THE ANTS WORK IN DIGGING OUT THEIR GRANARIES</p>

</div></div>




<p>And they have granaries, these ant farmers&mdash;hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of them, made just for that, each about the size of father's
watch.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei219" name="imagei219"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i219.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE INSIDE OF THE GRANARY</p>
<p class="ctext">Underneath the dome of the ant house you see in the previous picture, are flat chambers
like these, connected by galleries, in which the grain is stored. One is prepared not to be
surprised at anything about ants, but listen to this: The Agricultural Ants not only gather
and store this grain, but they actually plant and cultivate it. They sow it before the wet
season in the Fall, keep it weeded, and gather it in June of the following year. Seems incredible,
doesn't it? But I'm only telling you what McCook, an ant student, recognized
everywhere as a reliable observer, saw these six-footed Texas farmers actually do.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Now here's a thing; you stow away a lot of seeds in a
little hill where, of course, there's moisture, and what's
going to happen? Those seeds are going to sprout and
grow and spoil, and this, of course, destroys their value
as food. Then what are you going to do? Of course, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
human farmer would put his grains in a dry granary where
they couldn't sprout, but you see the ants haven't any
granary of that sort; nothing but those little holes in the
moist ground. Just what they do to these seeds has not
been discovered. They do something that keeps them
from either spoiling or sprouting. But, when they get
ready for these seeds to grow, they let them grow; not so
that they can raise a crop, but for the same reason that
the Chinaman lets the barley sprout that he uses in making
chop-suey; so that it will be nice and soft to eat. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
growing digests the starch in the seeds into sugar. When
the sprouts have grown as far as the ants want them to,
they gnaw the stalk a little, and cut off the roots with their
mandibles. When this sugar-making has gone on long
enough the ants bring all the plants out into the sun and
let them lie there until they are nice and dry. Then they
put them in their barns, and as long as Winter lasts they
live on this sweet flour, grinding it in their mouth mills
as they go along.</p>

<p>Why, it's like living on cookies, almost! Only the ants
have been used to this steady diet of sweets for ages, and
it doesn't hurt <i>their</i> little stomachs as it would ours.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei220" name="imagei220"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i220.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CLEANING UP AFTER THE DAY'S WORK</p>
<p class="ctext">While the Agricultural Ants don't take a bath after the day's work they do the next best
thing. They give each other a kind of massage, and they evidently find it very enjoyable.
You know how the cat loves to be stroked, dogs and horses to be patted, and little pigs to
have their backs scratched. The ants below are giving each other a massage (left, abdomen;
right, legs and sides). The lady above who seems to be braiding her back hair, is cleaning
her antennæ.</p>
</div></div>


<p>This particular kind of a farming ant is called the Attabara,
but there's another kind more wonderful still. If
we want to call on them by their scientific names&mdash;these
remarkable little creatures I'm going to tell about now&mdash;we'll
have to go to Texas and ask if the <i>Pogononyrmex
barbatus</i> family are at home.</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure," says the gentleman who first introduced
them to scientific society,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> "just come with me."</p>

<p>So he takes us over into Texas and shows us the ants
at work. They destroy every plant on their little farms
except that known as ant-rice. Compared to the size of
the ants themselves, these grain-fields are giant forests,
far bigger than the Sequoia Forests of California. The
ants watch for rain at harvest-time as anxiously as a farmer,
and on the first sunny day, they do their cutting and
hurry the grain into the barn. Then on later sunny days,
they bring it out to dry before finally storing it away.</p>

<p>"Well," you say, "is there anything left that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
farmers <i>don't</i> do?"</p>

<p>I can't think of anything except the planting. One observer
says that they do actually plant the seeds, and Doctor
McCook says, he wouldn't be surprised if they did,
but he never saw them do it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei225" name="imagei225"></a><div class="figborder">

<p class="caption">THE OLD HOME PLACE</p>
<p class="ctext">This is the farm of some Agricultural Ants in Texas. See the granary and the roads leading
to it? They collect and store the seeds of a plant which from this fact is called "ant-rice."
It looks like oats and tastes like rice. All plants growing around the nest&mdash;which is
also called the granary&mdash;the ants cut away, so clearing a space for 10 or 12 feet. Roads 5
inches broad near the nest, but narrowing as they recede, are made for hundreds of feet in
different directions.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In tropical America there is a species of ant that raises
"mushrooms"; at least a kind of fungus that passes for
mushrooms with the ants. They don't exactly set the
mushrooms out, but they save time by planting both the
mushrooms and the leaves that make them as one and the
same job. This is how they do it. They climb the trees,
cut circular pieces of leaf with their scissor-like jaws and
carry them back to low, wide mounds in the neighborhood
of which they allow nothing to grow; the purpose being,
as it is supposed, to ventilate the galleries of their homes
by keeping a clear space about the mound.</p>


<h5>HOW THE ANTS RAISE MUSHROOMS</h5>

<p>The leaves are used as a fertilizer on which grow a small
species of mushrooms. The leaves are first left out to be
dampened by the rain, and are carried into the ants' cellars
before they are quite dry. In very dry weather the ants
work only during the cool of the day and at night. Occasionally
inexperienced ants bring in grass or unsuitable
leaves, but these are carried out and thrown away by older
members of the family. But you see how valuable all these
leaves are to the soil.</p>

<h5><a name="MR_HAMSTERS_THRESHING_HARVESTER" id="MR_HAMSTERS_THRESHING_HARVESTER">MR. HAMSTER'S THRESHING HARVESTER</a></h5>

<p>Of course, we always expect the ants to do extraordinary
things, but one of those four-legged farmers I mentioned
in the beginning of the chapter anticipated the principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of the very latest type of threshing-machine. It's a fact.
This remarkable little animal threshing-machine is called
the hamster. He is found in Europe east of the Rhine and
in certain portions of Asia. He does both his cutting and
threshing in his field; something the Gauls did in the days
of the Romans in a crude way, but which men of our day
have only got to doing in recent years. He pulls down the
wheat ear, cuts it off between his teeth, and then threshes
it by drawing the heads through his mouth. The grain
falls right into sacks as fast as it is threshed; just as it
does in those huge, combined reapers and threshers that
you see on our big wheat farms. Mr. Hamster's sacks
are his cheek-pouches, one on each side. When these are
filled, this little threshing-machine turns itself into an auto,
a commercial truck, and off it goes with its load of wheat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to the little barn hidden in the ground. These cheek-pouches,
by the way, reach from the hamster's cheeks
clear back to his shoulders, and both of these pouches will
together hold something like a thousand grains of wheat.
He empties them by holding his paws tight against the
side of his face and then pushing forward. Rather a clever
unloading device, too; don't you think so? Just as good
for Mr. Hamster's purposes as the endless-chain system
at the Buffalo grain elevator that Mr. Kipling admired
so much.</p>

<p>And in the mere matter of the amount of grain handled,
the work of the hamster is not to be laughed at. The peasant
farmers are very glad to find a hamster granary, which,
of course, they promptly take possession of by due process
of law:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"The good old rule, the simple plan<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That they shall take who have the power,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And they shall hold who can."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of Mr. Hamster's neighbors, the field-rat of Hungary
and Asia, stores his grain right in the house&mdash;the
place where he lives with his family. Mr. Hamster, however,
has his barns separate from his home. Sometimes he
has one, sometimes two; and the older members of the
community may have four or five.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="II_Mr_Vole_and_His_Root_Cellar" id="II_Mr_Vole_and_His_Root_Cellar"></a>II. Mr. Vole and His Root Cellar</span></h4>

<p>The farmer I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter,
who is so thrifty about his root crops and so neat, belongs
to the Vole family. He lives away over in Siberia and his
full name is <i>Arvicola economus</i>. In gathering his crop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
roots, he first digs a little trench around them and lays
them bare. Then he cleans them off nicely so as not to
fill his storehouse with dirt; cuts them up in sizes convenient
for carrying, and then hauls them home and piles
them up in little cellars made specially for them.</p>

<p>He only takes one piece at a time, walking along backward
and pulling it after him with his teeth. He travels
long distances in this fashion, going around tufts of grass,
stones, and logs that lie in the way. When he gets home,
he backs in the front door and into the living-room, and
then into the barns which are back of the living-room.
There are several of these and they are at the end of a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
crooked passage.</p>

<p>Some of the Vole family make a specialty of wheat. One
species of these wheat harvesters used to be common in
Greece. He made such a nuisance of himself&mdash;from the
Greek farmer's standpoint&mdash;that the Greeks had a special
god to get after him; Apollo Myoktonos, "Apollo, Destroyer
of Mice."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> For the vole is just a kind of field-mouse.
The runs of these wheat-harvesting voles are eight
to twelve inches below the ground, and are connected with
the surface by vertical holes. The end of the run is enlarged
into a big room for the nest, and there are special
rooms leading from the main runway that are used for the
storing of the grain. These voles do their harvesting in
the evening. Standing on their hind legs and holding to
the stock with their little paws as a beaver clasps a tree,
they cut off the wheat head with their teeth. They work
very fast.</p>

<h5>HOW DID THESE FARMERS LEARN TO STORE?</h5>

<p>Neither the voles nor any other of these interesting
farmers and warehousemen used to get much credit for
what they did. The fact that they helped themselves to
some of the good things of earth annoyed Man, of course,
and then, when it came to the matter of intelligence, conceited
Mr. Man said: "Oh, <i>that's</i> just <i>instinct</i>." But nowadays
when scientists have begun to study to find out what
"instinct" really is, it is thought that man's brother animals,
although they are born with more knowledge of how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
to do things&mdash;with more of what we call "instinct"&mdash;have
also learned by experience just as man did. It is argued
that the storing habit was forced on animals wherever the
climate cut off the food-supply for a time&mdash;either because
it was too cold or too hot. The idea of putting something
by for a rainy day appealed particularly to the burrowers
because they are a timid lot. Not being able to defend
themselves very well against their enemies they were
obliged to pack up what they could and hurry to some
hidden eating-place. That is where the cheek-pouches,
which many of them have, come in handy. They are also
very industrious, and as the seeds and nuts on which they
lived began to ripen, they just couldn't resist the impulse
to gather and gather and gather more than they could
possibly eat at the time. So, as a result of this habit, food
piled up in their underground homes. Then, as they were
kept indoors by cold weather or by their enemies, they
took to eating more and more from the pantry shelf, and
thus the members of the family that were the busiest and,
therefore, had the most to eat would naturally survive and
leave children of a similar disposition, while the less thrifty
would die off.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">III. The Long Winter Sleep</span></h4>

<p>Some of these forehanded people, instead of putting
their Winter supply of food in the ground, put it on their
bones. That is to say, before turning in for the Winter,
they get as fat as can be and then live on this fat
until Spring. A great advantage of this system of storage
is that it is particularly pleasant work&mdash;you eat and eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and enjoy your meals, that's all. Another advantage is
that you can't be robbed of your store as easily as the
hamster, for example, frequently is. You carry it right
with you wherever you go.</p>

<p>There are a lot of curious things about this hibernation.
Not only will warmth arouse the sleepers but also extreme
cold, and after the extreme cold may come another sleep
from which the sleepers never awaken; in other words,
too much cold kills them. So the object of burying one's
self as the ground-hog does, or under the snow as rabbits
do, or in hollow caves and trees as Brer Bear does, is to keep
from getting too cold. Sometimes two or more "bunk"
together, as little pigs do on cold March days. The body
of each helps to keep his bedfellows warm.</p>


<h5><a name="ITS_THE_COLD_THAT_MAKES_ONE_DROWSY" id="ITS_THE_COLD_THAT_MAKES_ONE_DROWSY">IT'S THE COLD THAT MAKES ONE DROWSY</a></h5>

<p>It is the cold itself that seems to make hibernating animals
feel sleepy; just as it does human beings. At a moderate
temperature, say 45 or 50 degrees, dormice and hedgehogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
will wake up, eat something, and then go to sleep
again. The dormouse usually wakes in every twenty-four
hours, while the hedgehog's Winter naps are two or three
days long. Hunger seems to be the cause of their waking,
just as it is with babies. The little dormouse, as the air
grows colder, gradually dozes off, and his breathing is very
deep and slow. As the temperature rises, he begins to take
shorter and more rapid breaths and gradually wakes up.
Then, if he is in his own little home under the ground, he
feeds on the nuts and other foods that he stored in Autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and drops off again. He sleeps from five to seven months,
depending on the weather.</p>

<p>Moles and shrews, so far as observation goes, don't
hibernate. The moles simply dig deeper, and there they
find worms and insects that are buried away from the reach
of frost. The shrews hunt spiders and hundred-legged
worms and larvæ in holes and crannies of the soil or beneath
leaves of ground plants and old logs.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei228" name="imagei228"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i228.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">LITTLE HEDGEHOG IN MAN'S HAND</p>

</div></div>

<p>A queer thing is that the hedgehog, which belongs to
the same family as the shrew and the mole, is dead to the
world all Winter. Like all complete hibernators he stops
breathing entirely. The reason for this difference between
the hedgehog and the mole is that the mole doesn't need
to go to sleep, because he digs below the frost-line. As for
the shrews, they have little bodies and are very active, and
so get themselves food and keep warm, while the hedgehog
is so much bigger and slower that, when there is so little
to eat and it is so cold, he would either freeze or starve
to death if he went about looking for food. He finds it
cheaper to turn in and sleep than to work.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="imagei229" name="imagei229"></a><div class="figborder">
<img src="images/i229.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A HEDGEHOG AND HER BABIES</p>

</div></div>

<p>None of the tree-squirrels seem to take any unusually
long naps in the Winter. We often see them around on
pleasant days in the parks and in the woods. They run
out, get a few nuts from their stores, and then back again
to their nests, but the chipmunks and the gophers, who
are closely related to the squirrels, stay from late Autumn
to Spring in their burrows, where they have plenty of food
stowed away, and they sleep most of the time. In the
home of four chipmunks was found a pint of wheat, a
quart of nuts, a peck of acorns, and two quarts of buckwheat,
besides a lot of corn and grass seed; all to feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
four fat chipmunks. So, with such plentiful supplies, it is
not surprising that after their long Winter sleep the chipmunks
are as sleek as can be and as fat as butter, while
Mr. Bear comes out in the Spring lean and with his hair
all mussed up and as hungry as&mdash;well, as hungry as a bear!</p>

<p>All the bear family, except the polar bears, retire to caves
or some sheltered spot under a ledge of a rock or the roots
of a big tree. Among the polar bears the rule seems to
be that it's Mamma Bear only who goes to bed for the Winter.
She is careful to put on enough fat not only for herself,
but so that the babies that come along in the Spring
will have plenty of milk. She is buried by snow that drifts
on her and her breath melts a funnel up to the fresh air.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap"><a name="IV_Mr_Ground-Hog_and_His_Shadow" id="IV_Mr_Ground-Hog_and_His_Shadow"></a>IV. Mr. Ground-Hog and His Shadow</span></h4>

<p>The woodchuck, like the bear, is a "meat-packer."
People talk about him more or less in February. His other
name is "ground-hog" and his shadow is quite as famous
as he is. But is there anything in that old weather saw?
Well, yes and no. You see, it's like this: Mr. Ground-Hog
goes to bed very early in the Fall&mdash;long before the cold
weather sets in&mdash;and so he is up very early the next Spring;
long before the snow is all gone and, as it is with the other
all-Winter sleepers, a little extra warmth may wake him
up. Along toward morning, you know, we all begin to
stir around in our beds and get half awake. So in addition
to the fact that it is nearly daybreak for him&mdash;that
is to say, Springtime&mdash;let there come along a bright, warm
day in February&mdash;the second is as good as any other&mdash;and
Mr. Ground-Hog is likely to come out of his hole. And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
if he does, of course he will see his shadow, after which
there is likely to be quite a lot of cold weather.</p>


<h5>HOW WEATHER AVERAGES UP</h5>

<p>Not that his shadow makes any difference, but the point
is that if you have much warm weather <i>early</i> in February
you are likely to have colder weather <i>later</i> and running on
into March. It's just the law of averages, that's all. You
see it running through the year&mdash;this averaging up of
weather; it just sways back and forth like a pendulum.
Take it in any storm of rain or snow; first the clear sky,
then the clouds, then the downfall, and after that the clear
sky again. Take any month as a whole, or a year as
a whole, and it's the same way; you get about so much
rain, so much sunshine, so much heat and cold. The United
States Weather Bureau went to work once and, from the
records, classified the storms for the last thirty years, and
they found that about fifteen storms each year start over
the region of the West Gulf States, twelve begin over the
mountains of Colorado, forty cross the country from the
North Pacific by way of Washington and Oregon; and
so on, just about so many from each region each year.</p>

<p class="atext"><i>The Last Snow, by Lippincott</i></p>
</div>


<p>And records and old diaries, going back a hundred years,
show that the longer the period you examine for weather
facts, the closer the average. The weather for one ten-year
period will be almost as much like any other ten-year
period, as the peas in a pea shell are like each other. Coming
back to the subject of February weather, we find in
the diary of an old resident of Philadelphia in 1779: "The
Winter was mild, and particularly the month of February,
when trees were in bloom." He doesn't say anything about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the ground-hog, but there is this to be said of the sharper
changes of February and March, that at this season the
earth is getting more and more warmed up and yet the
cold winds from the North don't like to go; so there is a
constant wrestling-match, and it is the wrestling of the
winds one way and another that brings the changes of the
weather. So if the South Winds get the best of it early
in February, the North Winds, with their cold weather,
are likely to win later in the month, and vice versa.
Moreover, if you believe in the ground-hog proverb you
are apt to <i>notice</i> the warm days (or cold days, as the case
may be) for the next six weeks after February 2, and you
<i>won't</i> notice so much the weather that doesn't fit your
proverb! It's a way we all have; <i>seeing</i> the things that
go to prove what we believe and <i>overlooking</i> the things
that don't.</p>

February&mdash;the second is as good as any&mdash;and Mr. G.-H. is likely to come out and see his

weather later. It's the law of averages, that's all."</p>

<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</p>

<blockquote><p>I don't care what it says in "Alice in Wonderland," dormice
never drink tea; although dormice have been at table with people
ever since the days of the Romans. Dormice are still eaten in some
parts of Europe, and the Romans used to keep them as part of
their live stock. The European dormouse is really a little squirrel.
Varro's "Roman Farm Management" (of which you are apt to
find a good translation in the public library) tells how the Romans
put their dormice in clay jars specially made, "with paths contrived
on the side and a hollow to hold their food."</p>

<p>Crocodiles and other tropical animals take very long naps during
the hottest weather. Hartwig's "Harmonies of Nature" tells
about an officer who was asleep in a tent in the tropics, when his
bed moved under him, and he found it was because a crocodile,
in the earth beneath, was just waking up! Imagine what the
dried-up ponds and streams of the llanos of South America must
look like when the rainy season comes on, after the dry spell, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
crocodiles asleep just under the surface everywhere. Doctor Hartwig's
book tells.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable case of drying up that ever I heard
of was that of the Egyptian snail in the British Museum, that
Woodward tells about in his "Manual of the Mollusca." This
snail was sent to England, simply as a shell, in 1846. Never dreaming
there was anybody at home, they glued him to a piece of cardboard,
marked it <i>Helix Desertorum</i>, and there he stuck until March
7, 1850, when somebody discovered a certain thing that indicated
that there <i>was</i> somebody "at home," and that he was alive. They
gave him a warm bath and he opened his four eyes on the world!</p>

<p>In his "Animal and Vegetable Hedgehogs" ("Nature's Work
Shop") Grant Allen tells why the hedgehog works at night and
sleeps in the daytime.</p>

<p>How he fastens on his winter overcoat of leaves, using his spines
for pins, and how funny it makes him look.</p>

<p>How Mother Nature manages to have breakfast ready for him
in the Spring just when he is ready for <i>it</i>.</p>

<p>How hedgehogs use their spines when they want to get down
from a high bank or precipice real quickly.</p>

<p>How their eyes tell how smart they are; for a hedgehog is smart.</p>

<p>You will also find interesting things about hibernation in Gould's
"Mother Nature's Children" and Richard's "Four Feet, Two Feet
and No Feet."</p>

<p>In one of his essays on nature topics&mdash;"Seven Year Sleepers"&mdash;Grant
Allen tells how the toad goes to bed in an earthenware pot,
which he makes for himself, and how this habit may have helped
start the story that live toads are found inside of stones.</p>

<p>Ingersoll, in that delightful book I have already referred to several
times, "The Wit of the Wild," calls the pikas "the haymakers
of the snow peaks." In his article on these interesting little
creatures, he tells why you may often be looking right at one and
still not see it; why the pikas gather bouquets and why they always
lay them out in the hot sun; why their harvest season only lasts
about two weeks, and why, although they usually go to bed at
sunset, they work far into the night in harvest time.</p>

<p>"The Country Life Reader" has a good story of a woodchuck
named "Tommy." Among other things it tells about the variety
of residences a woodchuck has; and why animals that work at night,
as all woodchucks do, have an unusually keen sense of smell. Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
you guess why? The reason is simple enough.</p>

<p>Here's a clever bit of verse about the woodchuck by his other
name, that I came across in some newspaper:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"The festive ground-hog wakes to-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And with reluctant roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He waddles up his sinuous way<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And pops forth from his hole.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He rubs his little blinking eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">So heavy from long sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That he may read the tell-tale skies&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Which is it&mdash;wake or sleep?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ingersoll's "Nature's Calendar" tells why Brer Bear stays up
all winter when there is plenty of food, but goes to bed if food is
scarce; how he uses roots of a fallen tree to help when he is digging
his winter house; how he makes his bed and what he uses for the
purpose; how the winds help him put on his roof, and how he locks
himself in so tight that he can't get out until spring, even if he
wants to.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE DUST</h3>


<p>But whether they store it in their little barns, like the
chipmunk, or on their bones, like Brer Bear, these farmers
deserve more friendly understanding than they usually get
from that two-legged farmer, Mr. Man.</p>

<p>Just think of the ages upon ages that they have been
at work, these humble brothers of ours, and their ancestors&mdash;making
the soil that gives us food&mdash;and yet after all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
this Mr. Man comes along and says:</p>

<p>"Get out of my fields!"</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">I. The Lord of Creation</span></h4>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;please Mr. Man&mdash;we were here <i>first</i>!"</p>

<p>Was that the dormouse speaking? Anyhow, whoever
it was, I think he was more than half right, don't you?
Mr. Man, when he complains of these people, is apt not
only to forget what he owes to them but in claiming that
what they eat is wasted, to forget what a waster he is himself&mdash;wasting
the soil and wasting the trees and everything.</p>


<h5>BRER BEAR GIVES MR. MAN A PIECE OF HIS MIND</h5>

<p>"Now just don't you overdo this Lord-of-Creation
business, Mr. Man," says a deep, growly voice. (It must
be Brer Bear!) "Other people have rights as well as you!
And if you'd tend to your work half as well as they've attended
to theirs, for ages before you were born, this would
be a better world to live in; a good deal better, and there'd
be a lot more of the good things of life to go around.</p>

<p>"And now that you've waked me up I'm going to tell
you something else. You human beings are not only a
hard lot, but a stupid lot. You think you're mighty smart,
don't you, with your bear-traps and your shooting machines
that you shoot each other with, as well as shooting
the rest of us! But do you know what <i>I</i> think? I
think if some of us&mdash;the bears or the beavers or the ants,
for example&mdash;had had half your chance they'd have been
twice as smart; and then we bears might have gone around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
shooting at you, the way Mr. Beard showed once in one
of those funny pictures of his."</p>

<img src="images/i239.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HUNTING THAT DOESN'T HURT</p>
<p class="ctext">Hunting with a gun is great sport. But now you know from my story what good the
animals do in the world you may not like so well to kill them. And there is a new kind of
hunting that is just as much fun&mdash;with a camera. This picture shows a boy in ambush,
ready to shoot, by pressing a bulb; for the bird in the tree is exactly in front of the shutter
of the camera.</p>
</div></div>

<p>You see, Brer Bear has a good tongue in his head as well
as a wise old head on his shoulders, and I must say he's
entirely right when he makes the statement that human
beings aren't anywhere near as bright, according to the
chance they've had, as the bears and the beavers and the
ants and the bees, and many others that could be named.
Why, do you know that in the whole history of the human
race there have been only a few really bright people, like
Mr. Shakespere and Mr. Kipling, Mr. Archimedes and
Mr. Edison. It was such men as these&mdash;not over two thousand
or three thousand out of the millions upon millions of
human beings who have lived on the earth&mdash;that raised
the rest up from the Stone Age to where they are to-day.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Into the coarse dough of humanity an infrequent genius has
put some enchanted yeast."</p></blockquote>

<p>That's the way a recent English writer puts it. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
then he goes on to say that if snakes and beasts of prey
had been as clever as the bees and ants and beavers, men
would have been exterminated. They could have saved
themselves only by getting on with their education, climbing
up the grades, a good deal faster than they have done.</p>

<p>He says it&mdash;this Englishman&mdash;almost in the very words
of Brer Bear. And we can imagine Brer Bear going on,
taking up where the Englishman leaves off.</p>

<p>"In other words," says Brer Bear, "it was because the
bees and ants and beavers went on minding their own business,
neither hurting you nor giving any pointers to the
wolves and the lions and the snakes, that you're still here,
Mr. Lord Man! That's part of the story of how you got
to be lord of creation. Now listen to the rest of it:<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<blockquote><p>"'The cave-dwellings of men were stolen from cave-lions and
cave-bears; their pit-dwellings were copied from the holes and tunnels
burrowed by many animals; and in their lake-dwellings they
collected hints from five sources: natural bridges, the platforms
built by apes, the habits of waterfowl, the beaver's dam and lodge,
and the nests of birds. In the round hut, which was made with
branches and wattle-and-daub, stick nests were united to the plaster
work of rock martins. Yes, a good workman in the construction
of mud walls does no more than rock martins have done in all
the ages of their nest-building.</p>

<p>"'Suppose primitive man cut down a tree with his flint axe,
choosing one that grew aslant over a chasm or across a river; or
suppose he piled stepping-stones together in the middle of a waterway,
and then used this pier as a support for two tree trunks, whose
far ends rested on the bank sides. Neither of these ideas has more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
mother wit than that which has enabled ants to bore tunnels under
running water, and to make bridges by clinging to each other in a
suspension chain of their wee, brave bodies.'"</p></blockquote>


<h5>HOW MAN HELPED HIMSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS</h5>

<p>So you see that isn't just Mr. Bear's way of putting it;
there are human beings who think a good deal as he does.
Myself, I agree with Brer Bear and Brer Brangyn.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> For
man certainly, take him by and large, doesn't always set
a good example to his fellow animals, either in making the
best of his <i>opportunities</i> or in giving his humble brothers
a square deal.</p>

<p>Do you know what I felt like saying, back there in
<a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX</a>, when we were speaking of kingfishers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
how certain parties had given it out that kingfishers eat
big fish that otherwise might be caught with a hook or a
seine? This is what I <i>felt</i> like saying:</p>

<p>"What if they do? Who's got a better right?"</p>

<p>Then they'd say&mdash;these men&mdash;I suppose:</p>

<p>"Why, <i>we</i> have; <i>we're</i> sportsmen!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I'd say, "you're the kind of sportsman that's
so afraid somebody else will see and kill something before
you do; particularly if that somebody is itself a wild creature
that has to earn its living that way and only takes
what it needs for its family!"</p>

<p>And they're so good-natured about it, most of these
country cousins of ours, that we walked right in on and
ordered out, Cousin Woodchuck, for instance.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The woodchuck can no more see the propriety of fencing off&mdash;though
he admits that stone walls are fine refuges, in case he has
to run for it&mdash;a space of the very best fodder than the British
peasant can see the right of shutting him out of a grove where there
are wild rabbits, or forbidding him to fish in certain streams. So
he climbs over, or digs under, or creeps through, the fence, and
makes a path or a playground for himself amid the timothy and the
clover, and laughs, as he listens from a hole in the wall or under a
stump, to hear the farmer using language which is good Saxon but
bad morals, and the dog barking himself into a fit."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></blockquote>


<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The School of the Woods and Fields</span></h4>

<p>I don't mean to say, mind you, that the farmer hasn't
any rights in his own fields, and that he should turn everything
over to the woodchuck and the rest, but I do mean
to say that our wild kinsmen have rights and that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
is a lot more to be got out of them than their flesh or their
hides or the pleasure of killing them.</p>


<p>For one thing, the ant and the angleworm, the birds
and the woodchucks, the little
lichens and the big trees, the
winds and the rains, are all
teachers in the Great School
of Out-of-Doors, and in this
school you can learn almost
everything there is to be
learned. It's really a university.
Nature study, as you call
it in the grades, besides all the
facts it teaches you, trains the
eye to see, and the ear to
listen, and the brain to reason,
and the heart to feel.</p>

<p class="ctext">The great London banker who carried

<p>Once there was a London
banker who used to go around
with&mdash;what do you think&mdash;in his pockets? Money? Yes,
I suppose so; but what else? You'll never guess&mdash;ants!
He was a lot more interested in ants than he was in money;
and so, while the business world knew him as a big banker,
all the scientific world knew him as a great naturalist. He
wrote not only nature books but other books, including
one on "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7952">The Pleasures of Life</a>," and among life's greatest
pleasures he placed the "friendship," as he puts it, of things
in Nature. He said he never went into the woods but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
found himself welcomed by a glad company of friends,
every one with something interesting to tell. And, in
speaking of the wide-spread growth of interest in Nature
in recent years, he said:</p>


<blockquote><p>"The study of natural history indeed, seems destined to replace
the loss of what is, not very happily, I think, termed 'sport.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>And isn't it curious, when one comes to think of it, why
a man should take pleasure in seeing a beautiful deer fall
dead with a bullet in its heart? You'd think there would
be so much more pleasure in seeing him run&mdash;the very
poetry of motion. Or, why should a boy want to kill a
little bird? You'd think it would have been so much
greater pleasure to study its flight or to listen to the happy
notes pour out from that "little breast that will throb
with song no more."</p>


<h5>WHY MAN KILLS AND CALLS IT "SPORT"</h5>

<p>Among other animals that this banker naturalist studied
was man himself; man when he was even more of
an animal than he is to-day, and he came to the conclusion
that this curious killing instinct is a survival of the long
ages when man had to earn his living by the chase.</p>

to be looked up in the library. If we had gone

it's all one continued story, from the
making of the planets, circling in the fields of
space, to the making of the little dust grains that
are whirled along in the winds of March&mdash;if we

<h4><span class="smcap">III. The World Brotherhood</span></h4>

<p>An obvious thing in Nature is what is called "the struggle
for existence"; animals and plants fighting among
themselves and against enemies of their species in the universal
struggle for food. What is not so obvious, is how
the whole world of things works together toward the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
good.</p>

<p>For example, working with those quiet little people, the
lichens, is one of the biggest and noisiest things in the world&mdash;the
volcano. The volcanoes not only pour into the air
vast quantities of carbon-gas, which is the breath of life
to plants, but help the lichens and the rest of the soil-makers
with their work in other ways. And as the volcanoes
help the lichens get their breath, the lichens forward
the world service of the volcanoes by turning their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
lava into soil; in course of time, hiding the most desolate
of these black iron wastes under a rich garment of green.
It is thus the dead lava comes to life, and it is the very
smallest of the lichen family that starts the process.</p>

<p class="caption">HOW THE DEAD LAVA COMES TO LIFE</p>
<p class="ctext">Lava, after it has been converted into soil, by the agents of decay, makes the richest land
in the world. This picture shows a vineyard on the fertile plains overlooked by Mt. Ranier,
which is an extinct volcano. In the days when Mt. Rainer was being built these plains were
covered with molten lava.</p>
</div></div>


<p>Among the two principal gases of the air there is a working
brotherhood; just as there is between the plants and
the animals in their great breath exchange. The oxygen
in the air makes a specialty of crumbling up rock containing
iron. It rusts this iron into dust; while the CO<sub>2</sub>, as the
High School Boy calls what I have called carbon, for short,
goes after the rocks that contain lime, potash, and soda.</p>

<p>Working with both these gases is the frost that, with
its prying fingers, enlarges the cracks in stones, and so allows
the gases of the water and the air to reach in farther
than they could otherwise do.</p>

<p>Every Winter, with its frost and its storing up of moisture
in the great snow-fields of the mountains, is a benefit
to the lands and their people, but the Ice Age, "The
Winter that Lasted All Summer,"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> not only worked wonders
in other ways, but was of far greater benefit to the
soil because it was so much more of a Winter.</p>

<p>Mr. Shakespere, in his day, didn't know anything about
an Ice Age, but Brer Bear might have quoted certain lines
of his, just the same:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>With all the work the other agencies do in changing the
rock into soil, and fertilizing and refreshing it with additions
from the subsoil, there still remains an important
thing to be done, and that is to mix the soil from different
kinds of rock. This is still done constantly by the winds
and flowing waters, but every so often, apparently, there
needs to be a deeper, wider stirring and mixing. This the
great ice ploughs and glacial rivers of the Ice Ages did.
And they do it every so often, probably; for there was more
than one Ice Age in the past, and, as Nature's processes do
not change, it is more than likely there will be more ice
ages and more deep ploughing and redistribution of the
soil in the future. As you will see, if you take the trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
to look it up in "The Strange Adventures of a Pebble," it
is thought we may now be in the springtime of one of those
vaster changes which bring Springs lasting for ages, followed
by long Summers and Autumns, and by the age-long
Winters and the big glaciers and all.</p>

<p>The glaciers, moving over thousands of miles and often
meeting and dumping their loads together on vast fields,
did the very same thing for everybody that England does
for herself to-day in bringing different kinds of fertilizers
from all over the world to enrich her farms. I'm very glad
to speak of this because the author of the story of the pebble
may have left a bad impression of the glaciers&mdash;"The
Old Men of the Mountain"&mdash;as farmers, by what he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
about their carrying off the original farm lands of New
England, and leaving a lot of pebbles and boulders instead.
While these pebbles have not produced what you would
call a brilliant performer among soils, they have made a
good, steady soil that in New England has helped greatly
in growing farm boys into famous men, while the pebbles
of Wisconsin have been of immense service to her famous
cows. In the counties in Wisconsin where there are plenty
of pebbles scattered through the soil, the production of cheese
and butter is something like 50 per cent greater than it is
in regions where there are comparatively few pebbles.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p class="caption">GOOD CROPS FROM NEW ENGLAND'S STONY FIELDS</p>
<p class="ctext">While the stones, big and little, with which the fields of New England are so richly supplied
have not produced what you would call a brilliant performer among soils, they have made
a good steady soil that can turn its hand to almost anything, and that has helped greatly
in growing farm boys into famous men. In building those stone fences, for example, the
boys learned that it always pays to do your work well. A hundred years is merely the tick
of a watch in the life of a fence like that!</p>
</div></div>


<p>The soils of New England are like the New Englander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
himself, they can turn their hands to almost anything;
raise any kind of crop suited to the climate, while richer
soils are often not so versatile. The reason is that these
pebbles were originally gathered by the glaciers from widely
separated river-beds, and so contain all varieties of rock
with every kind of plant food in them. It takes a long,
long time to make soil out of bed-rock, but in the case of
soils in which there are a great many pebbles it is different;
and you can see why. On a great mass of rock there is
comparatively little surface for the air and other pioneer
soil-makers to get at, and so decay is slow; while the same
amount of rock broken up into pebbles presents a great
deal of surface for decay.</p>

<p>If you will examine with a glass&mdash;an ordinary hand-glass
will do&mdash;one of these decaying pebbles lying embedded
in the grass you can trace on it a number of wrinkly
lines&mdash;sometimes even a network. These are the marks,
the "finger-prints," of little roots. Little roots, as we have
seen, are very wise. They always know what they are
about, and the fact that they cling to the pebbles in this
way means that they are getting food out of them.</p>

<p>And that's right where the cows of Wisconsin come in.
The rootlets of the grasses get a steady supply of food from
the decaying surfaces of these pebbles scattered through
the pastures, and then pass it on to the cows.</p>

how are you going to account for the fact that in the counties in Wisconsin where there are
plenty of pebbles the production of cheese and butter is something like 50 per cent greater
than it is in regions where there are comparatively few pebbles? Examine, with a hand-glass,
the "finger prints" of the little roots on a decaying pebble, and see if you can't guess

<p>But now, going from little things to big things again,
notice how the mountains and the pebbles are linked together
in this chain of service. The mountains, too, continually
feed the plains. Ruskin, in speaking of this great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
service, says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The elevations of the earth's surface provide for it a perpetual
renovation. The higher mountains suffer their summits to be
broken into fragments, and to be cast down in sheets of massy rock,
full of every substance necessary for the nourishment of plants.
These fallen fragments are again broken by frost and ground by
torrents into various conditions of sand and clay&mdash;materials which
are distributed perpetually by the streams farther and farther from
the mountain's base. Every shower which swells the rivulets
enables their waters to carry certain portions of earth into new
positions, and exposes new banks of ground to be mined in their
turn. The turbid foaming of the angry water&mdash;the tearing down
of bank and rock along the flanks of its fury&mdash;these are no disturbances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of the kind course of nature; they are beneficent operations
of laws necessary to the existence of man, and to the beauty of the
earth; ... and each filtering thread of summer rain which trickles
through the short turf of the uplands is bearing its own appointed
burden of earth to be thrown down on some new natural garden in
the dingles below."</p></blockquote>

</div>



<p>So we find a wonderful variety of things working together
in making and feeding the soil that feeds the world:
mountains and pebbles, volcanoes and lichens, the breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
of the living and the bones of the dead; the sun, the winds,
the sea, the rains; the farmers with four feet, the farmers
with six feet; the swallow building her nest under the
eaves, the earthworms burrowing under our feet, each
bent on its own affairs, to be sure, but at the same time
each helping to carry on the great business of the universe.
From the little gizzard mills of the earthworm to the great
earth mills of the sea, that renew the soil for the ages yet
to come, all are&mdash;most evidently&mdash;parts of one great system;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
are together helping to work out great purposes in
the advance of men and things; purposes which require
that</p>

<blockquote><p>"While the earth remaineth, summer and winter, seed-time and
harvest, shall not cease."</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">HIDE AND SEEK IN THE LIBRARY</p>

<blockquote><p>As I said, most people not only think that they're smarter than
their fellow animals, but when you point out to them how clever
some of these other animals are, they say: "Oh, <i>that's</i> just instinct!"
As if animals don't think and learn by experience, and all, just as
we do! You look up "instinct" in the encyclopædia, and you'll
see. Then read Long's "Wood Folk at School."</p>

<p>There's really a lot more fun in shooting animals with a camera
than with a shotgun or a rifle. Did you ever try it? "Hunting
with a Camera" in "The Scientific American Boy at School," by
Bond, will tell you how to get the best results. Other good pointers
on animal photography will be found in Verrill's "Boy Collector's
Hand Book" ("Photographing Wild Things") and in
"<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18525">On the
Trail</a>," by A. B. and Lina Beard.</p>

<p>And if you ever feel like killing a bird "just for fun," read in the
diary of "Opal" about the farmer boy who shot the little girl's
pet crow; it was "only a crow," he said, and he wanted to see if he
could hit it. That will cure you, I think. The diary of "Opal"
reads like a fairy-tale, but it's all true, and although it was written&mdash;every
word of it&mdash;by a little girl of seven, it is one of the most
remarkable books that anybody ever wrote. The crow's name, by
the way, was "Lars Porsina of Clusium." The little girl used to
give her pets names like that.</p>

<p>Don't forget what the great naturalist, Agassiz, said about the
pencil being "the best eye"; that is to say, you can get a more
accurate knowledge of things and come nearer to seeing them as
they really are, by drawing them. Drawing, in the best schools, is
a part of Nature Study, and when you get so that you can draw
fairly well&mdash;as everybody can with practice&mdash;you will find there is
even more of a thrill in thus <i>creating</i> forms&mdash;out of nothing, as you
might say&mdash;than there is in taking photographs. The pencil is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
magician's wand! As an example and inspiration for taking your
pencil and sketch-book into the fields, get "Eye Spy," by Gibson,
and, of course, Seton's animal books. I do believe Seton drew his
pictures with those simple, expressive outlines so that young folks
could redraw them. The difference between redrawing a drawing
and simply looking at it, is a lot like the difference between <i>reading</i>
a book and merely glancing at the print.</p>

<p>You are sure to be interested in Sir John Lubbock's book on
"Ants, Bees and Wasps," and you will find a world of interesting
things about the earlier animal days of man in his "Origin of Civilization"
and "Pre-Historic Times."</p>

<p>And who do you suppose had most to do with teaching men they
were really brothers, and so bringing them up to the civilized life
we know to-day? Mother! (See Drummond's "Ascent of Man,"
or Chapter XII of "The Strange Adventures of a Pebble," where the
whole marvellous story of evolution is told in simple form.)</p>

<p>If Nature Study proves half as delightful and profitable to you
as I am sure it will, the following list of books will be very useful
in building up your library on the subject, and in selecting books
from the public library:</p>

<p>"<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19381">Among the Farmyard People</a>," by Clara D. Pierson, deals with
various things you probably never noticed about chickens and pigs,
and other domestic animals. "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/34943">Among the Meadow People</a>," by
the same author, tells about birds and insects. You can see what
her "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35002">Among the Pond People</a>" tells about&mdash;tadpoles, frogs, and
so on. Really, it's a perfect fairy-land, an old pond is! "Among
the Moths and Butterflies," by Julia P. Ballard, is about fairies,
too, as the title shows.</p>

<p>For children of the seventh to eighth grades, and up, Hornaday's
"American Natural History" will be a delight, and it has
loads of pictures which, as in all well-illustrated scientific books,
are as valuable as the text. You know who Hornaday is, don't
you? He is the man at the head of the great Zoo in New York
City.</p>

<p>Margaret W. Morley's "The Bee People" is worthy of its subject,
and that's about the highest praise you could give to a book
about bees, I think. Then don't forget, when you are in the library,
to look up her "Grasshopper Land." The grasshopper book
also treats of the grasshopper's cousins, which include the crickets
and the katydids; yes, and the "walking sticks"; and the "praying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
mantis." (Did you know that whether you spell this weird little
creature's first name, "praying," with an "e" or an "a" you'd be
correct?)</p>

<p>Every boy and girl, of course, is supposed to know about Ernest
Thompson Seton's books, but for fear some of them don't, I'll
mention a few that it simply wouldn't do to miss.
"<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2284">Animal
Heroes</a>" gives the history of a cat, a dog, a pigeon, a lynx, two
wolves and a reindeer; "Krag and Johnny Bear" is made up from
his larger book, "Lives of the Hunted"; "Lobo, Rag and Vixen"
is from his "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3031">Wild Animals I Have Known</a>,"
and "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32319">The Trail of the Sandhill Stag</a>."</p>

<p>John Burroughs is very different from Seton and Long, but the
older you get the better you will like him. His is one of the great
names in the study of Nature's pages at first hand and, as literature,
ranks with the work of Thoreau. Get his
"<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3163">Birds, Bees and Other
Papers</a>," "<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23714">Squirrels and Other Fur-bearers</a>."</p>

<p>Darwin, one of the greatest men in the whole history of science&mdash;the
man whose name is most prominently identified with the greatest
discovery in science, the principle of evolution&mdash;how do you
suppose he started out? Just by looking around! Read about it
in "What Mr. Darwin Saw in His Voyage around the World."</p></blockquote>

shows a lion getting home rather late, after his night out, stopping for
a look at the rising sun; a thing with which, owing to his habits, he is
not very familiar.</p>

and the whole family is known as the <i>Formicidæ</i>. To a Roman boy
<i>Formica</i> simply meant "ant." <i>Fusca</i> is also Latin, and means "dark";
so you can see this part of the story is about a species of dark ant. As
a matter of fact he is dark brown.</p>

<p>Transcriber's note:</p>

<p>In the scanned version of this book, there is apparently a printer error in the acknowledgments for sources of
illustrations (page x) where the author refers to an illustration on page
125.  There is no illustration on page 125 in the original text, so the
hyperlink in this ebook has been connected to the closest illustration, (caption: This Must Be a Pleasant Day) which is on page
126 in the original text.</p>

<p>Another possible printer error occurred on page 52, where the phrase
"branches and holes" appears in the original text.  In an effort to relate the context
of the phrase, this has been changed to
"branches and boles" in this text.</p>

<p>Full-page illustrations have been moved to the nearest paragraph so as not to interrupt
the flow of the text.  Some page numbers are missing as a result.  </p>

<p>Where appropriate, internal hyperlinks within the index link directly to the pertinent
chapter heading, section, or illustration referred to on the referenced
page.  In cases where no appropriate heading was available on the page, the top of the
referenced page is linked.  In some cases illustrations have been moved from the original location
in order to avoid breaks in paragraphs, and to place them more closely
to the related paragraph.  For example, the index reference
for "Hornbills" (page 169) links directly to the illustration now located on
page 170.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
